# This is an R script
# You can type, save and run your commands here
# You can also write comments by typing hashtag (#) followed by the text of your comment (like these comments you are reading now)
# Anything that is not preceded by a hashtag is recognised by R as an executable command and will try to execute it if you run the script; like the one below:

1 + 3 - 5 + 7

# To execute the command above, you can either place the cursor anywhere on that line (or select the command lines) and click CNTRL+ENTER, or click on the Run button in this script window's toolbar above.

# Results from executed commands are printed in the Console window (the one below, by default)
# The command above performs the arithmetic operation and results in the number 6

# Let's start by installing and loading some useful user-written packages using the 'install_packages' and 'library' functions included in base-R packages. Run the commands below:

install.packages("tidyverse")

library(tidyverse)

# We now have access to functions contained in the 'tidyverse' bundle of packages. 

# Below you can type your own commands, or you can copy/paste commands from the Lab6 online worksheet and execute them here
