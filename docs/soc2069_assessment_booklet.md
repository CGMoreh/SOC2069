Both assessments must be submitted online via Canvas and Turnitin.

The resit will be an unseen exam covering all the module content.

# Assessment 1: Qualitative data analysis report

To complete this assignment, you will be using interview transcripts from a real research project on Young People and Brexit, conducted in 2017 by Sioned Pearce and Stuart Fox at Cardiff and Brunel Universities (see https://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854031 for more information about their project). The interviews they conducted with young people, exploring their feelings about and responses to Brexit, are all available to download from Canvas.

Your task is to complete some initial qualitative data analysis on this dataset. 

Choose **five or six** of the interviews from the dataset (no more) and read through the transcripts thoroughly. Then do the following:

1.  Identify the main themes and sub-themes in the transcripts and code them accordingly (you can do this any way you like, manually or electronically);

2.  Write this analysis up into a short essay on young people’s feelings about and responses to Brexit. The themes you choose to focus on should be the most relevant and/or interesting in your dataset, and you should include relevant quotations from your transcripts. Think about:
            a.  Why the themes are important;
            b.  Links or contradictions between themes and sub-themes;
            c.  Anything you can glean about the positionalities of the interviewees (gender, race, class etc) and whether this is relevant;
            d.  How your analysis supports, contradicts or extends existing literature (just look at two or three sources from the list below; you do not need to do a full literature review).
  
3.  Your essay should also include a short section on how you coded the documents and derived the themes, and a reflection on this process (including how your own positionality might have impacted on your analysis).

**Your essay should be 1500 words long and should have a title, an introduction and conclusion, sub-sections (if relevant) and a reference list. Use the Harvard method of referencing as usual. You do not need to reference your interview transcripts; these count as data.**

# Assessment 2: Quantitative analysis report

This assessment is a brief research report worth 50% of the overall module mark. In this report, you will answer an empirical research question using the same quantitative dataset used during the semester in the IT workshops (from the *Understanding Society* survey). Using this dataset, you will identify several variables that you find relevant to answering your chosen research question. Towards the end of the teaching semester, a few optional research report questions will be suggested, but alternatively you can choose your own.

You will perform an analysis building on a simple but robust regression model and you will present it in a reproducible format that includes all the code used for the analysis. We will be using the `R` statistical programming language and the `RStudio` IDE to conduct our analyses, and you will do the same for the assessment report. The ideal format for submission will be a Microsoft Word document generated from an `Rmd` file, which includes all your text, code and outputs (tables, graphs). We will practice doing this in the IT labs in the second half of the module.

The report format also requires you to frame the analysis and findings sociologically and in reference to relevant academic literature on the topic.

**This report should also be 1,500 words long and should follow the common structure of quantitative research articles.** You could structure your report something like this:

1.  Title

    - Always give a title to a report. The title should relate to your main question, but does not have to replicate it

2.  Introduction (~100 words)

    - This should be a brief paragraph stating very briefly and generally: your research question; one or two main points from the literature that you reviewed; your data source and methods that you will be using.

3.  Review of literature (~300 words)

    - You may choose to incorporate your literature review into the introduction, following the opening brief paragraph.
    - Here you highlight some of the main findings from other academic work on the topic you examine.

4.  Data and Methods (~100 words)

    - Introduce the source of your data, the variables that you found useful to answer the research question, and the methods you used

5.  Results (~400)

    - Here you present the results of your analysis, including tables, figures and interpretation; this is essentially what you have done for the practical exercise, but using further variables and tests.

6.  Discussion and Conclusion (~400)

    - Here you provide a sociological interpretation of your results. This is best done by connecting your findings back to the literature that you reviewed
    - Include one brief concluding paragraph

7.  References (excluded from word-count)

    - a minimum of ~5 academic sources relating to the research question must be used. Any non-academic sources (e.g. reference to the dataset, statistical methods from textbooks, internet or media resources, etc.) must be additional to these.

# General assessment guidance

## Academic misconduct

Newcastle University does not condone plagiarism, or any other form of assessment irregularity and follows procedures for dealing with alleged assessment irregularities.

This includes permitting another student to copy, verbatim or in substance, any assessed coursework (including providing an opportunity for another student to copy work, even if it was not the explicit intention that the work should be copied) and/or allowing the sharing of any assessed work on a website or in any other medium.

The University has the right to investigate any allegation of an assessment irregularity against a student and may take disciplinary action where it decides, on the balance of probabilities, that an assessment irregularity has occurred.

## What happens if I’m ill and can’t meet the deadline?

Extensions are managed through the Personal Extenuating Circumstances (PEC) process. Extensions will usually only be granted for medical or other serious problems. You should negotiate this before the original submission date unless sudden ill-health makes this impossible. You will need to complete a Personal Extenuating Circumstances (PEC) form (available from the GPS School Office or online at [https://www.ncl.ac.uk/student-progress/circumstances/pec/](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/student-progress/circumstances/pec/) and attach any medical or other evidence in support of your request. Please submit this to the GPS School Office if you are a student from this school, or to your home school, if your degree programme is not located within GPS. Please note that extensions will only be given with the approval of the Senior Tutor via the GPS office. Please do not approach individual Module Leaders for extensions. Students can normally expect to receive a decision about an application for an extension within three working days, provided the form is completed correctly, by email (more details can be found in the Degree Programme Handbook).

## What happens if I submit late?

Any work submitted after 12 midday on the advertised day of submission will be subject to the University’s late submission policy, unless an extension has been agreed with the Senior Tutor. The University’s policy is that any assessed work submitted after the deadline up to 7 days late can receive a maximum mark of 40%. Work handed in after 7 days without an extension will receive a mark of 0. It is your responsibility to act quickly and to go through the proper extensions procedure if you require one. More details can be found in the Degree Programme Handbook.

## Word limits

For assessments work must be within the specified word limit: writing to a word limit is one of the skills on which you are assessed. You must clearly indicate the word count at the end of each assignment. The bibliography is not included in the word limit. Assignments which exceed the word limit by more than 10% may be subject to a deduction of up to 10 marks. This is at the discretion of the Module Leader. If it is applied, the marker will indicate the deduction clearly on the assessment feedback sheet.

## Academic style and the Harvard system

Your written work must conform to the Harvard referencing system (see the referencing guide in your student handbooks and on Canvas). It should be typed in 12-point sans-serif font (such as Arial, Calibri, or GillSans). Assessed work which does not use the Harvard system and/or does not conform to the specified  style may be subject to a deduction of up to 5 marks. This is at the discretion of the Module Leader. If it is applied, the marker will indicate the deduction clearly on the assessment feedback sheet. For further guidance on referencing see the Style Guide in your Sociology Student Handbook.

## Feedback

Feedback on the assessment will be through the following routes:

- Comments provided in your text, and/or in your individual feedback sheet on Canvas;

- Generic feedback via Canvas or email to the class on common points of good and bad practice amongst the group on the piece of assessment;

- The opportunity to have one-to-one feedback with the module leader at a time which will be advertised well in advance and which you can sign up for. If this time is not possible for you an alternative time can be agreed.
