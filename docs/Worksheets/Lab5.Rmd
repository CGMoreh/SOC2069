    Timetable week: 9
    Topic: "Analysing qualitative data"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Intro

While in the previous two weeks we practiced creating data collection instruments and finding textual data online, this week we turn to methods of analysing qualitative data collected through those instruments and techniques. Analysing qualitative data is a complex process involving organizing and categorizing the empirical materials and interpreting their meaning with reference to theories. There are many ways in which this can be done, such as the following (taken from Kara (2005: 102); see there to follow up on the references cited for each method):

- content analysis: a semi-quantitative technique for counting the number of instances of each category or code (Robson 2011: 349)
- thematic analysis: identifying themes from coded data (Robson 2011: 475)
- narrative analysis: analysing stories from primary or secondary data (Bryman 2012: 582)
- conversation analysis: detailed analysis of the verbal and non-verbal content of everyday interactions (Bryman 2012: 527)
- discourse analysis: analysing patterns of speech and interaction in a detailed and sometimes semi-quantitative way, for example by measuring the length of pauses (Bryman 2012: 529)
- metaphor analysis: analysing metaphors from primary or secondary data (Fletcher 2013: 1555–6)
- phenomenological analysis: analysing participants’ stories from, and descriptions of, their ‘life-worlds’, or individual experiences and perceptions, with a focus on meaning (Papathomas and Lavallee 2010: 357; Mayoh, Bond and Todres 2012: 28)
- life course analysis: analysis of the ‘interaction between individual lives and
social change’ (Brittain and Green 2012: 253).

You will have read about the various stages of the qualitative data analysis process in the assigned readings, but in this workshop we will be focusing on the practicalities of data reduction and categorization. One of the most commonly applied methods for qualitative data analysis is *thematic analysis*, which relies on *thematic coding* of the data, and we will focus on this technique. We will rely here most heavily on the detailed step-by-step guidance provided in **Gerson and Damaske (2020, Chapter 6)** and the concepts described by **Neuman (2014, Chapter 14)**. If you haven't read them yet, open the books on pages 143 and 480, respectively, to have them in the background for reference.

# Exercise 1: 

`About 20 minutes + 5 minutes discussion`

------------------------------------------------------------------------
We return to one of the example projects we looked at on Worksheet 3: the “EU Kids Online” project and their qualitative toolkit resources: https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/eu-kids-online/toolkit/qualitative-research.

You should already be familiar with the description of the project, its aims, methodology and data collection instruments from previous weeks. To remind yourself of those instruments, you can open the *Individual interview topic guide* and the *Focus group topic guide* and have a quick look through them. 

In this exercise we will focus on the resources related to *coding* the primary qualitative material obtained from the interviews and focus groups. The reserach team provides a good guide on how the analysis took place, so the first task is to open their [Technical report](https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/assets/documents/research/eu-kids-online/toolkit/qualitative-research/QualitativeMethodReport.pdf) on the qualitative research. 





```{block Question 1, type = 'questionblock'}

**Questions**

```

## Task 1: 


```{block , type = 'discussion'}
**Discussion**

The F column in the *Concepts & references* sheet lists how the questions asked in the questionnaire relate to the broader theoretical concepts that the research aims to measure. We find that some concepts are operationalised through a simple direct survey question (e.g. "Age" or "Online interaction with unknown people"), while other concepts require a number of survey questions. Look at a few complex concepts and discuss what you think are the positives and negatives of how they have been operationalised in the questionnaire.

# Exercise 2:

`About 15 minutes + 10 minutes discussion`
