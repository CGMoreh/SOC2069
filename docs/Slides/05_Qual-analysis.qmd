> We have two tasks after we have gathered our data, namely to reduce our data to something we can manage, and to analyze our data in meaningful ways (**Luker 2008: 198-199**)

> Analysis involves a constant moving back and forward between the entire data set, the coded extracts of data that you are analysing, and the analysis of the data that you are producing (**Braun and Clarke**)

1. Familiarize yourself with your data
2. Assign preliminary codes to your data in order to describe the content
3. Search for patterns or themes in your codes across the different interviews
4. Review themes
5. Define and name themes
6. Produce your report
