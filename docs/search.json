    "text": "Timetable week: 4\nTopic: \"Questions, Data, Models\"\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nBy the end of the session, you should be familiar with:\n\nsome important cross-national and UK large-scale representative survey programmes\nhow to access data from the UK Data Service and other data repositories\nhow to find, download and read data documentation, including survey questionnaires\nthe challenges of measuring sociological concepts\nopening the RStudio interface\n\n\n\nIntro\nThe lecture has provided a broad introduction to sociological questions, data and conceptual model-building. You will practice asking questions and thinking about the best models to answer them throughout the module. In this first practical lab, you will begin your data analysis journey by exploring some online sources of reliable, high-quality sociological data available for secondary analysis.\nThroughout the semester, we will be using the research topic of (social) trust to guide our data analysis, but as we progress, exercises will ask you to apply the methods we practised to other sociological concepts operationalised in the datasets that we will use. This will help you build up your skills and confidence in asking and addressing research questions of your own.\nAs a first exercise, let’s explore the survey mentioned in the lecture: the World Values Survey\n\n\nExercise 1: Find and download the WVS wave 7 data documentation\nAbout 20 minutes\n\n\nTask 1\nNavigate to the The World Values Survey (WVS) website and read about the World Values Survey.\n\n\n\nDon’t spend too much time browsing the website, but make sure you can answer the following questions:\n\n\n\nWhen was the WVS started, and how many waves of data collection have there been so far?\n\n\nIn which year(s) did the most recent wave of data collection take place?\n\n\nHow many countries were covered by the most recent wave?\n\n\nCan you name some of the topics covered by the WVS?\n\n\nWhat population are the national samples representative of?\n\n\nWhat is the general minimum sample size per country?\n\n\nIs the WVS data freely available for academic research purposes?\n\n\nDo you need to cite/reference the WVS data if you use it in your research?\n\n\nBonus: what is the difference between a time series dataset and a panel dataset, and which of the two can the WVS provide? (tip: look under Data and Documentation &gt; Data Download &gt; Timeseries (1981-2022) for a concise discussion)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2\nIf you haven’t yet done so, create a folder for this module on your institutional OneDrive (e.g. C:\\OneDrive - Newcastle University\\SOC2069). Within that folder, create a sub-folder called “Data”. Within the “Data” folder, create another sub-folder called “WVS7”. You can now save files relating to WVS data into that folder, and because it is stored on the institutional OneDrive, you will always have access to it on any computer, once you log in to your institutional Microsoft Windows account.\nOn the WVS website , navigate to the Wave 7 data section (Data and Documentation &gt; Data Download &gt; Wave 7 (2017-2022) and download the Master Questionnaire and the Codebook documents to your newly created “WVS7” folder.\nOpen the two PDF documents and using the search function identify all the survey questions and variables that relate to trust.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\nHow many questions relating to trust have you identified in the questionnaires?\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the questionnaire and the codebook?\n\n\nIn how many different ways is trust measured in the WVS?\n\n\nWhat are, in your opinion, the advantages and disadvantages of the different measurements of trust?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Explore some other cross-national surveys\nAbout 20 minutes\n\nThere are several large-scale social surveys that are conducted internationally and allow researchers to compare different societies. There is a Wikipedia article that lists many such surveys. In this exercise, we will explore three further cross-national surveys that routinely include measurements of social trust.\nTo save time, you will organise in three groups, and each group will explore at least one of the following surveys:\n\nThe European Social Survey (ESS)\nThe European Values Study (EVS)\nThe International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)\n\nAs you have done in the previous exercise, create a new sub-folder for these surveys, where you can save the documentation and always have it at hand.\nNavigating the survey websites, identify the latest wave/round of published data for each survey. The EVS and the ISSP are using the GESIS data repository (at the University of Leibniz) to store their data, and you will be taken to that website. You can also search the https://search.gesis.org/ site directly for various data, beyond the EVS and ISSP. Please note that you do not have to register in order to download the documentation; if you are asked to register, you have made a wrong click at some point. When you will want to download the actual data files, you will need to register first, but htat can wait for now.\nLocate the data documentation and download the questionnaire and the codebook. Each survey has a slightly different way of referring to and naming these documents, and they often have versions in various languages and several supplements. Make sure to download the main/master survey document in English.\nWere you to explore all the surveys we discussed so far and download the mentioned documentation files keeping their original names, your folder structure should look something like this:\n\n\nD:/OneDrive - Newcastle University/SOC2069/Data\n├── ess10\n│   ├── ESS10_appendix_a7_e03_1.pdf\n│   └── ESS10_source_questionnaires.pdf\n├── evs2017\n│   ├── ZA7500_bq_CAPI.pdf\n│   └── ZA7500_cdb.pdf\n├── issp2020\n│   ├── ZA7650_bq.pdf\n│   └── ZA7650_cdb.pdf\n└── wvs7\n    ├── F00010738-WVS-7_Master_Questionnaire_2017-2020_English.pdf\n    ├── F00011055-WVS_7_Codebook_Variables_report.pdf\n    └── F00011421-WVS_Cross-National_Wave_7_rds_v5_0.zip\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\nIn how many different ways is trust measured in the surveys you have explored?\n\n\nWhat are the main similarities and differences in the surveys that you have looked at?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Exploring the UK Data Service\nAbout 30 minutes\n\nSo far we have explored a number of international comparative surveys. UK-based researchers also have access to data hosted by the UK Data Service (UKDS), the country’s largest data repository. It makes a variety of data available to UK researchers for secondary analysis. The UKDS is available at this website: https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/\nIt is also useful to become acquainted with the variety of secondary data available there and the basic functionalities of the site, as you may decide to use secondary data for your final third-year dissertation.\nBegin by exploring the options available under the Find data tab of the UKDS website. The Find data page contains a short video on How to use the UK Data Service catalogue search tool, which you can watch outside class. As we are just exploring the data offerings of the service, navigate to the Browse and access data page, where you can browse data by theme or type, among some other options. Let’s choose to Browse by data type and select UK Surveys.\nThis takes us to the main data catalogue, where we can see that the search is filtered down to “UK Survey data” in the Data Type field of the menu on the left. We can perform various selections using that menu, refining the search by date or setting other filters.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nLook at the information on the UKDA Data catalogue page and answer:\n\n\n\nHow many studies are available on the UKDA in total?\n\n\nHow many data series are available? (Series are large surveys that are taken regularly; they can be longitudinal/panel or time series)\n\n\nHow many studies categorised as UK Survey data are there?\n\n\n\nTo check whether you’ve found the correct information, you can check the answers below.\n\n\n\nClick to view answer\n\n\nThe numbers shown in the main tab refer to the overall number of studies available through the UKDA, so at the time of writing there were 9194 individual studies and 77 series. Did you find the same?\n\n\nThe number of results in the light blue box above the results list refer to the number of studies based on our set filter, so in this case 4968 in UK Survey data.\n\n\n\n\nTake some time to explore and become familiar with the page. Try to:\n\nFind the newest studies based on their date of collection (tip: check out Sort by)\nRemove the filter on data type and scroll through some of the most recently released datasets\nSearch a keyword of your own interest in the search field (Search our data catalogue) (e.g. ‘migration’, ‘gender violence’, or any topic you are currently interested in). How many studies did you find?\nChoose one study that you find most interesting and read through the details. Write down a few notes on the aims, methodology, etc. employed:\n\nWhat was the main aim of the study? (usually stated somewhere in the abstract)\nWhen was the study conducted and where?\nWhat kind of data was collected? (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, mixed, etc.)\nWhat was the sampling methodology?\nWhat were the methods of data collection?\nUnder what conditions are the data available? (tip: click on Access data) \\(\\rightarrow\\) read more about data access conditions here\n\nAre there any Series that matched your keyword? This is useful information because the Series contain data from large-scale publicly funded surveys with publicly available data that can be used for secondary analysis.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nWhat you have found out about your chosen study/topic?\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Find qualitative and mixed data\nYou will likely finish this exercise outside class. But don't worry, we will be looking at qualitative data in the second part of the module, and we will return to this exercise then.\nIf there are less than 10 minutes left of the class, please proceed instead to Exercise 5\n\nMost of the secondary data available on the UKDS is quantitative. But we can find some qualitative and mixed methods studies too, some of which have made their data (e.g. transcribed and anonymized interview data) available. We can find such studies if we Browse by data type. Give it a go - but remember to clear your previous search to find all qualitative and mixed methods studies, not only the ones relevant to your keyword.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nHow many qualitative and mixed methods studies are available on the UKDA in total?\n\n\n\nClick to view answer\n\n\nAt the time of writing there were 1665\n\n\n\n\nYou may have found some studies that you find interesting based on their titles. You can have a closer look at them outside class, but because not all datasets are equally well documented and made available, you can have a closer look at a few studies that I find particularly interesting:\n\nStetka, Vaclav and Mihelj, Sabina and Toth, Fanni and Kondor, Katherine (2022) “The Illiberal Turn? News Consumption, Polarization and Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe, 2019-2020” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855088\nWrighton, Sam J (2021) “The Annexation of Populations: A New State Strategy, 2017-2021” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854598\nEinarsdottir, Anna and Mumford, Karen and Birks, Yvonne and Lockyer, Bridget and Sayli, Melisa and Jeep, Sudthasiri (2021) “LGBT+ Networks, 2017-2020” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855322\nPearce, Sioned and Fox, Stuart (2020) “Young people and Brexit 2017” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854031\n\nWrite down a few notes on the aims, methodology, etc.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nWhat are the most interesting aspects of these studies? (i.e. things that really caught your attention)\n\n\n\nIf one of the studies has caught your attention, make a note of it, as we will use some data from them later for the purposes of the second assignment.\n\n\nExercise 5: Open RStudio for the first time\nBefore we conclude this practical lab, let’s check if we can access the software that we will be using from next week to analyse data.\nLet’s return to Exercise 1 and the Data Download section of the WVS website for Wave 7: https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp.\nScroll down to the “Statistical Data Files” section and click to download the WVS Cross-National Wave 7 R v5 0.zip (rds) data file. This will open up a registration page, and it is now time to create a free account in order to access the raw data from the survey. Fill in the registration form, accept ‘the conditions of use’, and click “DOWNLOAD”. Save the file in your “WVS7” folder.\nYou can extract the file from the zipped folder - but for our purposes you may be able to simply click on the compressed folder to see the contents. Ideally, if the computer has an active version of R and RStudio installed and the .rds extension is associated with it, you should see a blue RStudio icon before the data file name, as in the picture below:\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble-click on the file to open it. If the file type is already associated with RStudio, then a dialogue box will open up asking if you would like to load the data into an R object of the same name.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext week we will see why it’s a good idea to give much shorter names to R data objects, but for now you can just click “OK”. This will open up the RStudio interface.\nIf the .rds extension is not associated with R/RStudio on your PC, don’t panic. But let’s check to make sure that you have the software available on the computer. Click on the “Windows” icon and search for apps/programmes on the computer. Search for RStudio and see if you can locate the software. If you find it, double-click on it to open it up.\nNext week we will start by loading data into R via RStudio, so feel free to begin navigating the software’s interface in your spare time. You should also download R and RStudio to your personal computers so you have access to them outside class.\nIt’s also a good idea to begin completing the first few episodes of the R for Social Scientists online training to gain some familiarity with the software before you encounter it in exercises in next week’s practical lab.\n\n\nOutro\nWe have now seen some examples of social science data and have learnt how to find out more about them and how to access them. Thinking ahead to your third-year dissertation, you may want to register for a free user account on the UKDS or some of the other data repositories we have explored. The UKDS provides some great resources and advice on using their data for undergraduate dissertations and there’s also an annual Dissertation Award! So, keep this great option in mind.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Aims\nSociology is based on systematic knowledge about the social world that we inhabit. ‘Researching Social Life I’ introduces the range of ways that sociologists do research by collecting empirical information so that they can develop their sociological ideas. Its core theme is the importance of evidence: the way we collect and analyse information has a huge effect on our research findings. Data analysis is a practical activity, and therefore the module is distinctive in involving a series of hands-on computer labs and seminars, as well as being focused on practical assignments. It is in these applied sessions that you will convert the principles explained in the lectures into skills, so that you too can carry out research. Although concerned to convey the systematic application of appropriate professional standards, the module also tries to communicate some of the excitement and fun of doing research. The module makes four main contributions to the degree program:\n\nIt lays a foundation of knowledge and critical awareness about how research gets done, which helps to appreciate and make sense of the other sociological sources used in the rest of the degree’s modules.\nIt enables the best choice of research methods to be made for doing your research for the Final Year Dissertation in sociology.\nMore generally, the informed and critical thinking learned in the module can also be applied to analyse what really lies behind media news-stories, politicians’ speeches, lobby groups’ reports on social problems – and even gossip – that we all encounter as citizens.\nFinally, because Research Social Life I delivers a substantial part of “what every sociology graduate can be expected to know”, having studied the subject, it offers the opportunity to acquire transferable skills for later employment in a range of professions. These include interviewing, analysing social behaviour, using computers to process quantitative information, where to locate data on public issues and how to apply them, and how to make sense of social surveys."

    "text": "These are real-life data from large-scale nationally representative surveys that include variables relating to (social) trust. The datasets have been prepared for use in lab exercises and the assignment. All the original data are freely available for research purposes from their respective data repositories, but they generally require registration before the data can be accessed. The datasets listed on this page are slightly processed versions of the raw data to make them more easily usable by students. Typically, variable types and labels have been corrected and the number of variables reduced to those of the greatest potential interest to sociology students. Variable names and coding have not been altered, so that students can rely on the survey documentation (questionnaires, codebooks) to better understand the variables in the dataset. The codebooks shown on this page describe the processed datasets. The processed datasets can be downloaded by students from the module’s Canvas page for the purpose of coursework, but for all other research purposes students are asked to download the original raw data from the data repositories. The R code available on this page can be run on the raw datasets to reproduce the processed datasets."

    "text": "These are real-life data from large-scale nationally representative surveys that include variables relating to (social) trust. The datasets have been prepared for use in lab exercises and the assignment. All the original data are freely available for research purposes from their respective data repositories, but they generally require registration before the data can be accessed. The datasets listed on this page are slightly processed versions of the raw data to make them more easily usable by students. Typically, variable types and labels have been corrected and the number of variables reduced to those of the greatest potential interest to sociology students. Variable names and coding have not been altered, so that students can rely on the survey documentation (questionnaires, codebooks) to better understand the variables in the dataset. The codebooks shown on this page describe the processed datasets. The processed datasets can be downloaded by students from the module’s Canvas page for the purpose of coursework, but for all other research purposes students are asked to download the original raw data from the data repositories. The R code available on this page can be run on the raw datasets to reproduce the processed datasets."

    "text": "These are real-life data from large-scale nationally representative surveys that include variables relating to (social) trust. The datasets have been prepared for use in lab exercises and the assignment. The original raw data files are freely available for research purposes from their respective data repositories, but they generally require registration before the data can be accessed.\nThe datasets listed on this page are slightly processed versions of the raw data to make them more easily usable by students. Typically, variable types have been corrected and labels have been imported to R; the number of variables were reduced to include those of the greatest potential interest to sociology students. Variable names and coding have not been altered, so that students can rely on the survey documentation (questionnaires, codebooks) to better understand the variables in the dataset.\nThe codebooks shown on this page describe the processed datasets. The processed datasets can be downloaded by students from the module’s institutional Canvas page for the purpose of coursework, but for all other research purposes students are asked to download the original raw data from the data repositories. The R code available on this page can be run on the raw data to reproduce the processed datasets and can serve as a basis for further data wrangling.\nAvailable datasets for download:\nMore datasets will become available in the future."

The aim in this module is to address substantive research questions with the use of R rather than achieve a deep understanding of R itself. For this reason, it is expected that you develop your R skills beyond the minimum required by the worksheets outside class.\nYou may have already begun the “R for Social Scientists” online training, in which case you should already be familiar with the basics of R, RStudio and RStudio projects. If you haven’t yet started the course, in the first exercise below you will get started.\n\n\nExercise A1: Getting to know RStudio and RStudio Projects\nAbout 15  minutes\n\nThe term “R” is used to refer to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it. To make it easier to interact with R, we will use RStudio. RStudio is the most popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R. An IDE is a piece of software that provides tools to make programming easier.\nR and RStudio should be available on all computers in the IT clusters. You can find RStudio among the list of programs (in the Start menu) and open the programme directly. This will open a new RStudio session in the computer’s default working directory. However, to make sure that all your files are in the same place and accessible regardless of the computer you are using, it’s best to get into the practice of using RStudio projects. An RStudio Project stores all the files and data objects and performs all the operations relative to the location of the project’s root file on the computer.\n\nNavigate to the “1. Before we Start” section of the “R for Social Scientists” course and work your way through that section.\nIf you have kept up with the exercises in Lab 1, you should already have a folder for your work on this module that is organised something like this:\n\n\nD:/OneDrive - Newcastle University/SOC2069/Data\n├── ess10\n│   ├── ESS10_appendix_a7_e03_1.pdf\n│   └── ESS10_source_questionnaires.pdf\n├── evs2017\n│   ├── ZA7500_bq_CAPI.pdf\n│   └── ZA7500_cdb.pdf\n├── issp2020\n│   ├── ZA7650_bq.pdf\n│   └── ZA7650_cdb.pdf\n└── wvs7\n    ├── F00010738-WVS-7_Master_Questionnaire_2017-2020_English.pdf\n    └── F00011055-WVS_7_Codebook_Variables_report.pdf\n\n\nLast week we saved all the survey documentation materials there for the various surveys you read about. If you already have a folder like this, try turning the /SOC2069/ parent folder into an RStudio Project. You can start off with the same steps (File &gt; New project &gt;), but instead of New directory choose Existing directory and find your /SOC2069/ folder on OneDrive. When you are done, you will see that a new file with the extension .Rproj has been created in the folder.\nThe great advantage of having an .Rproj file in the folder that you are using is that you don’t have to worry about setting manually any paths to files that you will be using or producing; everything is stored relative to where the .Rproj file is located on your computer.\nIf you do not yet have a folder for the module set up on OneDrive - Newcastle University, follow the instructions in the course and set up a new project as a new directory, creating the advised folders. Then, organise your data or the documents folder (documents may be a good option if you then plan on storing the data files separately from the survey documentation material, but it’s up to you) to have the sub-folders shown above as you will be using these to store data files in later exercises.\n\n\n\nExercise A2: Explore the RStudio (main) Panes\nAbout 15  minutes\n\nLet’s have a closer look at the four (main) panes of RStudio:\n\n\nThe R Console Pane\nThe R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R “engine”. This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. The Console is the direct interface to the R software itself; it’s what we get if instead of RStudio we open the R software: a direct interface to the R programming language, where we can type commands and where results/messages are printed.\nYou can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script. For this reason, we should not use the Console pane directly too much. For typing commands that we want R to execute, we should instead use an R script file, where everything we type can be saved for later and complex analyses can be built up.\n\n\nThe Source Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is a space to edit and run your scripts. This pane can also display datasets (data frames) for viewing.\n\n\nThe Environment Pane\nThis pane, by default the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of objects in the R Environment in the current session. These objects could include imported, modified, or created datasets, parameters you have defined, or vectors or lists you have defined during analysis. You can click on the arrow next to a dataframe name to see its variables.\n\nNote\nIf your Environment pane is empty, it means that you don’t have any “objects” loaded or created yet. We will be creating some objects later and we will also import an example dataset.\n\n\n\nFiles, Plots, Packages, Help, etc\nThe lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).\nYou can arrange the panes in different ways, depending on your preferences, using Tools &gt; Global Options in the top menu. So the arrangement of panes may look different on different computers.\n\n\n\nExercise A3: Using R scripts and RMarkdown/Quarto documents\nAbout 15  minutes\n\nR scripts are special text documents where you can write and execute commands in the R programming language. You can create an R Script from within RStudio by going to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script (also CNTRL + SHIFT + N), or clicking on the New File button on the toolbar:\n\nIf you followed the steps in the training in the previous exercise, you should already have produced your first R script (script.R). It’s a good idea to have a separate script for each lab - e.g. name your R script from this session Lab2.R.\nApart from R scripts, RStudio allows for the easy editing and processing of another plain text file type, one which allows us to combine human-readable text (such as the one we would write in a Microsoft Word document) with executable computer code that generates output (e.g. data processing, tables, graphs, etc.). These file types are called Quarto markdown documents (.qmd) (or RMarkdown (`.Rmd), an earlier implementation available in older versions of RStudio; this may be the case in some computer clusters). You can open a new Quarto (or RMarkdown) document by going to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document, or with the New File button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the “29. Quarto” section of the “R for Data Science” (2nd ed.) book and work your way through the first few sections of that chapter\nQuarto markdown is a reimagined version of R Markdown. The two are very similar. Newer versions of RStudio have Quarto pre-installed, making it much easier to work with Quarto files and projects. Older versions rely on RMarkdown. You can also learn more about the latter in the “7. Getting started with R Markdown” section of the “R for Social Scientists” course.\nCreate a new .qmd document for “Lab 2” with a few basic items in it (some section headings, some text, a code block; you haven’t yet learnt any useful commands in the R language to write in the code chunk, but you can use R as a simple calculator too, so come up with some simple mathematical calculations that you want the code to evaluate and give you the results for). Your end product would look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Task 3.3: Visualising distributions\nIt is often useful to make a graph to visualise a variable, especially a numeric variable. A figure can often convey information in a much more efficient way that a statistic/number. One of the most useful graph types for visualising numeric variables is a histogram. Again, there are many functions available in R for producing graphs. Once you become more proficient and use R more often, it is very useful to learn the graphing workflow of the ggplot2 package (included in the tidyverse), which builds up a graph canvas step by step using various elements. That allows the creation of highly customized figures of publishable quality. But for very basic graphs that we use only to get a general impression, we can use some more basic functions. The plotting functions included in the mosaic package can be useful for this purpose. For example, the histogram function from mosaic produces the following figure:\n\nhistogram( ~ age_dv, data = data)\n\nThis function has a similar structure to the functions that we will use for statistical modelling, generically of the form goal(y ~ x, data = my_data). In our case, we are only “modelling” one variable here, so the first (y-axis) object before the tilde (~) is missing. The data can be specified with the option data = .... In our case, the actual name that we gave to our data object is data, so we have data = data.\nWe can also easily superimpose a normal distribution curve over the histogram to check whether the numeric variable is more or less normally distributed or not:\n\nhistogram( ~ age_dv, data = data, fit = \"normal\")\n\nDensity plots are also useful for this purpose:\n\ndensityplot( ~ age_dv, data = data)\n\nWe can also add a categorical variable to break down the graph into groups. For instance, we can use the sex variable that we are already familiar with to visualise the age distribution of men next to that of women. To do this, we add the categorical variable after a vertical bar (|):\n\nhistogram( ~ age_dv | sex, data = data, fit = \"normal\")\n\nWhat we can learn from all these figures is that the age distribution of our respondents is not perfectly normal, with a thicker left tail showing a higher numbers of under-30 year-olds."

The %&gt;% “pipe” originates from the user-written package magrittr and was widely adopted in the tidyverse. The |&gt; version is a new native operator introduced in recent versions of R. It looks a bit simpler than the original pipe, and it behaves somewhat differently (we won’t get into that here). The Windows Rstudio keyboard shortcut to insert the pipe character is Ctrl + Shift + M, which by default inserts the original version. You can change the RStudio settings to insert the native version instead. If you get to use RStudio more, you may want to do this (in the RStudio Menu bar, go Tools &gt; Global Options…, click Code and then tick the box “Use native pipe operator”).

Half (50%, i.e. 75%-25%) of the values in the variable fall between these two values. The range of values between the two is also known as the interquartile range (IQR), and it’s a similar measure of spread/dispersion of the data as the standard deviation (SD) or the variance (the square of the SD), but more robust against outliers.\nthe MAD refers to the median absolute deviation, another measure of data dispersion. It is the median of the absolute values of the deviations of each data point from the data’s median.\nthe MAP (for Maximum A Posteriori probability estimate) is effectively an equivalent of the mode for numeric/continuous variables.\nthe skewness and kurtosis of a distribution is easiest to evaluate visually, but there are rules of thumb for evaluating the statistics; if the skewness value is roughly between -0.5 and 0.5, the distribution is approximately symmetric; values between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1 reflect moderate negative or positive skewness, respectively; if the skewness is lower than -1 (negative skewed) or greater than 1 (positive skewed), the data are extremely skewed. Similarly, kurtosis values greater than 3 denote a leptokurtic shape (peaked, with thick tails), values below 3 a platykurtic (flatter) shape, and values around 3 denote a roughly normal distribution. The values of -0.71 thus means a strongly platykurtic (flat) distribution. We can get a better sense of what this means by looking at a visual description of the variable’s distribution."
