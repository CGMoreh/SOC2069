    "text": "These are real-life data from large-scale nationally representative surveys that include variables relating to (social) trust. The datasets have been prepared for use in lab exercises and the assignment. The original raw data files are freely available for research purposes from their respective data repositories, but they generally require registration before the data can be accessed.\nThe datasets listed on this page are slightly processed versions of the raw data to make them more easily usable by students. Typically, variable types have been corrected and labels have been imported to R; the number of variables were reduced to include those of the greatest potential interest to sociology students. Variable names and coding have not been altered, so that students can rely on the survey documentation (questionnaires, codebooks) to better understand the variables in the dataset.\nThe codebooks shown on this page describe the processed datasets. The processed datasets can be downloaded by students from the module’s institutional Canvas page for the purpose of coursework, but for all other research purposes students are asked to download the original raw data from the data repositories. The R code available on this page can be run on the raw data to reproduce the processed datasets and can serve as a basis for further data wrangling.\nAvailable datasets for download:"

    "text": "Timetable week: 4\nTopic: \"Questions, Data, Models\"\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nBy the end of the session, you should be familiar with:\n\nsome important cross-national and UK large-scale representative survey programmes\nhow to access data from the UK Data Service and other data repositories\nhow to find, download and read data documentation, including survey questionnaires\nthe challenges of measuring sociological concepts\nopening the RStudio interface\n\n\n\nIntro\nThe lecture has provided a broad introduction to sociological questions, data and conceptual model-building. You will practice asking questions and thinking about the best models to answer them throughout the module. In this first practical lab, you will begin your data analysis journey by exploring some online sources of reliable, high-quality sociological data available for secondary analysis.\nThroughout the semester, we will be using the research topic of (social) trust to guide our data analysis, but as we progress, exercises will ask you to apply the methods we practised to other sociological concepts operationalised in the datasets that we will use. This will help you build up your skills and confidence in asking and addressing research questions of your own.\nAs a first exercise, let’s explore the survey mentioned in the lecture: the World Values Survey\n\n\nExercise 1: Find and download the WVS wave 7 data documentation\nAbout 20 minutes\n\n\nTask 1\nNavigate to the The World Values Survey (WVS) website and read about the World Values Survey.\n\n\n\nDon’t spend too much time browsing the website, but make sure you can answer the following questions:\n\n\n\nWhen was the WVS started, and how many waves of data collection have there been so far?\n\n\nIn which year(s) did the most recent wave of data collection take place?\n\n\nHow many countries were covered by the most recent wave?\n\n\nCan you name some of the topics covered by the WVS?\n\n\nWhat population are the national samples representative of?\n\n\nWhat is the general minimum sample size per country?\n\n\nIs the WVS data freely available for academic research purposes?\n\n\nDo you need to cite/reference the WVS data if you use it in your research?\n\n\nBonus: what is the difference between a time series dataset and a panel dataset, and which of the two can the WVS provide? (tip: look under Data and Documentation &gt; Data Download &gt; Timeseries (1981-2022) for a concise discussion)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2\nIf you haven’t yet done so, create a folder for this module on your institutional OneDrive (e.g. C:\\OneDrive - Newcastle University\\SOC2069). Within that folder, create a sub-folder called “Data”. Within the “Data” folder, create another sub-folder called “WVS7”. You can now save files relating to WVS data into that folder, and because it is stored on the institutional OneDrive, you will always have access to it on any computer, once you log in to your institutional Microsoft Windows account.\nOn the WVS website , navigate to the Wave 7 data section (Data and Documentation &gt; Data Download &gt; Wave 7 (2017-2022) and download the Master Questionnaire and the Codebook documents to your newly created “WVS7” folder.\nOpen the two PDF documents and using the search function identify all the survey questions and variables that relate to trust.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\nHow many questions relating to trust have you identified in the questionnaires?\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the questionnaire and the codebook?\n\n\nIn how many different ways is trust measured in the WVS?\n\n\nWhat are, in your opinion, the advantages and disadvantages of the different measurements of trust?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Explore some other cross-national surveys\nAbout 20 minutes\n\nThere are several large-scale social surveys that are conducted internationally and allow researchers to compare different societies. There is a Wikipedia article that lists many such surveys. In this exercise, we will explore three further cross-national surveys that routinely include measurements of social trust.\nTo save time, you will organise in three groups, and each group will explore at least one of the following surveys:\n\nThe European Social Survey (ESS)\nThe European Values Study (EVS)\nThe International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)\n\nAs you have done in the previous exercise, create a new sub-folder for these surveys, where you can save the documentation and always have it at hand.\nNavigating the survey websites, identify the latest wave/round of published data for each survey. The EVS and the ISSP are using the GESIS data repository (at the University of Leibniz) to store their data, and you will be taken to that website. You can also search the https://search.gesis.org/ site directly for various data, beyond the EVS and ISSP. Please note that you do not have to register in order to download the documentation; if you are asked to register, you have made a wrong click at some point. When you will want to download the actual data files, you will need to register first, but htat can wait for now.\nLocate the data documentation and download the questionnaire and the codebook. Each survey has a slightly different way of referring to and naming these documents, and they often have versions in various languages and several supplements. Make sure to download the main/master survey document in English.\nWere you to explore all the surveys we discussed so far and download the mentioned documentation files keeping their original names, your folder structure should look something like this:\n\n\nD:/OneDrive - Newcastle University/SOC2069/Data\n├── ess10\n│   ├── ESS10_appendix_a7_e03_1.pdf\n│   └── ESS10_source_questionnaires.pdf\n├── evs2017\n│   ├── ZA7500_bq_CAPI.pdf\n│   └── ZA7500_cdb.pdf\n├── issp2020\n│   ├── ZA7650_bq.pdf\n│   └── ZA7650_cdb.pdf\n└── wvs7\n    ├── F00010738-WVS-7_Master_Questionnaire_2017-2020_English.pdf\n    ├── F00011055-WVS_7_Codebook_Variables_report.pdf\n    └── wvs7.rds\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\nIn how many different ways is trust measured in the surveys you have explored?\n\n\nWhat are the main similarities and differences in the surveys that you have looked at?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Exploring the UK Data Service\nAbout 30 minutes\n\nSo far we have explored a number of international comparative surveys. UK-based researchers also have access to data hosted by the UK Data Service (UKDS), the country’s largest data repository. It makes a variety of data available to UK researchers for secondary analysis. The UKDS is available at this website: https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/\nIt is also useful to become acquainted with the variety of secondary data available there and the basic functionalities of the site, as you may decide to use secondary data for your final third-year dissertation.\nBegin by exploring the options available under the Find data tab of the UKDS website. The Find data page contains a short video on How to use the UK Data Service catalogue search tool, which you can watch outside class. As we are just exploring the data offerings of the service, navigate to the Browse and access data page, where you can browse data by theme or type, among some other options. Let’s choose to Browse by data type and select UK Surveys.\nThis takes us to the main data catalogue, where we can see that the search is filtered down to “UK Survey data” in the Data Type field of the menu on the left. We can perform various selections using that menu, refining the search by date or setting other filters.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nLook at the information on the UKDA Data catalogue page and answer:\n\n\n\nHow many studies are available on the UKDA in total?\n\n\nHow many data series are available? (Series are large surveys that are taken regularly; they can be longitudinal/panel or time series)\n\n\nHow many studies categorised as UK Survey data are there?\n\n\n\nTo check whether you’ve found the correct information, you can check the answers below.\n\n\n\nClick to view answer\n\n\nThe numbers shown in the main tab refer to the overall number of studies available through the UKDA, so at the time of writing there were 9194 individual studies and 77 series. Did you find the same?\n\n\nThe number of results in the light blue box above the results list refer to the number of studies based on our set filter, so in this case 4968 in UK Survey data.\n\n\n\n\nTake some time to explore and become familiar with the page. Try to:\n\nFind the newest studies based on their date of collection (tip: check out Sort by)\nRemove the filter on data type and scroll through some of the most recently released datasets\nSearch a keyword of your own interest in the search field (Search our data catalogue) (e.g. ‘migration’, ‘gender violence’, or any topic you are currently interested in). How many studies did you find?\nChoose one study that you find most interesting and read through the details. Write down a few notes on the aims, methodology, etc. employed:\n\nWhat was the main aim of the study? (usually stated somewhere in the abstract)\nWhen was the study conducted and where?\nWhat kind of data was collected? (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, mixed, etc.)\nWhat was the sampling methodology?\nWhat were the methods of data collection?\nUnder what conditions are the data available? (tip: click on Access data) \\(\\rightarrow\\) read more about data access conditions here\n\nAre there any Series that matched your keyword? This is useful information because the Series contain data from large-scale publicly funded surveys with publicly available data that can be used for secondary analysis.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nWhat you have found out about your chosen study/topic?\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Find qualitative and mixed data\nYou will likely finish this exercise outside class. But don't worry, we will be looking at qualitative data in the second part of the module, and we will return to this exercise then.\nIf there are less than 10 minutes left of the class, please proceed instead to Exercise 5\n\nMost of the secondary data available on the UKDS is quantitative. But we can find some qualitative and mixed methods studies too, some of which have made their data (e.g. transcribed and anonymized interview data) available. We can find such studies if we Browse by data type. Give it a go - but remember to clear your previous search to find all qualitative and mixed methods studies, not only the ones relevant to your keyword.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nHow many qualitative and mixed methods studies are available on the UKDA in total?\n\n\n\nClick to view answer\n\n\nAt the time of writing there were 1665\n\n\n\n\nYou may have found some studies that you find interesting based on their titles. You can have a closer look at them outside class, but because not all datasets are equally well documented and made available, you can have a closer look at a few studies that I find particularly interesting:\n\nStetka, Vaclav and Mihelj, Sabina and Toth, Fanni and Kondor, Katherine (2022) “The Illiberal Turn? News Consumption, Polarization and Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe, 2019-2020” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855088\nWrighton, Sam J (2021) “The Annexation of Populations: A New State Strategy, 2017-2021” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854598\nEinarsdottir, Anna and Mumford, Karen and Birks, Yvonne and Lockyer, Bridget and Sayli, Melisa and Jeep, Sudthasiri (2021) “LGBT+ Networks, 2017-2020” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855322\nPearce, Sioned and Fox, Stuart (2020) “Young people and Brexit 2017” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854031\n\nWrite down a few notes on the aims, methodology, etc.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nWhat are the most interesting aspects of these studies? (i.e. things that really caught your attention)\n\n\n\nIf one of the studies has caught your attention, make a note of it, as we will use some data from them later for the purposes of the second assignment.\n\n\nExercise 5: Open RStudio for the first time\nBefore we conclude this practical lab, let’s check if we can access the software that we will be using from next week to analyse data.\nLet’s return to Exercise 1 and the Data Download section of the WVS website for Wave 7: https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp.\nScroll down to the “Statistical Data Files” section and click to download the WVS Cross-National Wave 7 R v5 0.zip (rds) data file. This will open up a registration page, and it is now time to create a free account in order to access the raw data from the survey. Fill in the registration form, accept ‘the conditions of use’, and click “DOWNLOAD”. Save the file in your “WVS7” folder.\nYou can extract the file from the zipped folder - but for our purposes you may be able to simply click on the compressed folder to see the contents. Ideally, if the computer has an active version of R and RStudio installed and the .rds extension is associated with it, you should see a blue RStudio icon before the data file name, as in the picture below:\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble-click on the file to open it. If the file type is already associated with RStudio, then a dialogue box will open up asking if you would like to load the data into an R object of the same name.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext week we will see why it’s a good idea to give much shorter names to R data objects, but for now you can just click “OK”. This will open up the RStudio interface.\nIf the .rds extension is not associated with R/RStudio on your PC, don’t panic. But let’s check to make sure that you have the software available on the computer. Click on the “Windows” icon and search for apps/programmes on the computer. Search for RStudio and see if you can locate the software. If you find it, double-click on it to open it up.\nNext week we will start by loading data into R via RStudio, so feel free to begin navigating the software’s interface in your spare time. You should also download R and RStudio to your personal computers so you have access to them outside class.\nIt’s also a good idea to begin completing the first few episodes of the R for Social Scientists online training to gain some familiarity with the software before you encounter it in exercises in next week’s practical lab.\n\n\nOutro\nWe have now seen some examples of social science data and have learnt how to find out more about them and how to access them. Thinking ahead to your third-year dissertation, you may want to register for a free user account on the UKDS or some of the other data repositories we have explored.

The aim in this module is to address substantive research questions with the use of R rather than achieve a deep understanding of R itself. For this reason, it is expected that you develop your R skills beyond the minimum required by the worksheets outside class.\nYou may have already begun the “R for Social Scientists” online training, in which case you should already be familiar with the basics of R, RStudio and RStudio projects. If you haven’t yet started the course, in the first exercise below you will get started.\n\n\nExercise A1: Getting to know RStudio and RStudio Projects\nAbout 15  minutes\n\nThe term “R” is used to refer to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it. To make it easier to interact with R, we will use RStudio. RStudio is the most popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R. An IDE is a piece of software that provides tools to make programming easier.\nR and RStudio should be available on all computers in the IT clusters. You can find RStudio among the list of programs (in the Start menu) and open the programme directly. This will open a new RStudio session in the computer’s default working directory. However, to make sure that all your files are in the same place and accessible regardless of the computer you are using, it’s best to get into the practice of using RStudio projects. An RStudio Project stores all the files and data objects and performs all the operations relative to the location of the project’s root file on the computer.\n\nNavigate to the “1. Before we Start” section of the “R for Social Scientists” course and work your way through that section.\nIf you have kept up with the exercises in Lab 1, you should already have a folder for your work on this module that is organised something like this:\n\n\nD:/OneDrive - Newcastle University/SOC2069/Data\n├── ess10\n│   ├── ESS10_appendix_a7_e03_1.pdf\n│   └── ESS10_source_questionnaires.pdf\n├── evs2017\n│   ├── ZA7500_bq_CAPI.pdf\n│   └── ZA7500_cdb.pdf\n├── issp2020\n│   ├── ZA7650_bq.pdf\n│   └── ZA7650_cdb.pdf\n└── wvs7\n    ├── F00010738-WVS-7_Master_Questionnaire_2017-2020_English.pdf\n    ├── F00011055-WVS_7_Codebook_Variables_report.pdf\n    └── wvs7.rds\n\n\nLast week we saved all the survey documentation materials there for the various surveys you read about. If you already have a folder like this, try turning the /SOC2069/ parent folder into an RStudio Project. You can start off with the same steps (File &gt; New project &gt;), but instead of New directory choose Existing directory and find your /SOC2069/ folder on OneDrive. When you are done, you will see that a new file with the extension .Rproj has been created in the folder.\nThe great advantage of having an .Rproj file in the folder that you are using is that you don’t have to worry about setting manually any paths to files that you will be using or producing; everything is stored relative to where the .Rproj file is located on your computer.\nIf you do not yet have a folder for the module set up on OneDrive - Newcastle University, follow the instructions in the course and set up a new project as a new directory, creating the advised folders. Then, organise your data or the documents folder (documents may be a good option if you then plan on storing the data files separately from the survey documentation material, but it’s up to you) to have the sub-folders shown above as you will be using these to store data files in later exercises.\n\n\n\nExercise A2: Explore the RStudio (main) Panes\nAbout 15  minutes\n\nLet’s have a closer look at the four (main) panes of RStudio:\n\n\nThe R Console Pane\nThe R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R “engine”. This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. The Console is the direct interface to the R software itself; it’s what we get if instead of RStudio we open the R software: a direct interface to the R programming language, where we can type commands and where results/messages are printed.\nYou can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script. For this reason, we should not use the Console pane directly too much. For typing commands that we want R to execute, we should instead use an R script file, where everything we type can be saved for later and complex analyses can be built up.\n\n\nThe Source Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is a space to edit and run your scripts. This pane can also display datasets (data frames) for viewing.\n\n\nThe Environment Pane\nThis pane, by default the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of objects in the R Environment in the current session. These objects could include imported, modified, or created datasets, parameters you have defined, or vectors or lists you have defined during analysis. You can click on the arrow next to a dataframe name to see its variables.\n\nNote\nIf your Environment pane is empty, it means that you don’t have any “objects” loaded or created yet. We will be creating some objects later and we will also import an example dataset.\n\n\n\nFiles, Plots, Packages, Help, etc\nThe lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).\nYou can arrange the panes in different ways, depending on your preferences, using Tools &gt; Global Options in the top menu. So the arrangement of panes may look different on different computers.\n\n\n\nExercise A3: Using R scripts and RMarkdown/Quarto documents\nAbout 15  minutes\n\nR scripts are special text documents where you can write and execute commands in the R programming language. You can create an R Script from within RStudio by going to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script (also CNTRL + SHIFT + N), or clicking on the New File button on the toolbar:\n\nIf you followed the steps in the training in the previous exercise, you should already have produced your first R script (script.R). It’s a good idea to have a separate script for each lab - e.g. name your R script from this session Lab2.R.\nApart from R scripts, RStudio allows for the easy editing and processing of another plain text file type, one which allows us to combine human-readable text (such as the one we would write in a Microsoft Word document) with executable computer code that generates output (e.g. data processing, tables, graphs, etc.). These file types are called Quarto markdown documents (.qmd) (or RMarkdown (`.Rmd), an earlier implementation available in older versions of RStudio; this may be the case in some computer clusters). You can open a new Quarto (or RMarkdown) document by going to File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document, or with the New File button:\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto markdown is a reimagined version of R Markdown. The two are very similar. Newer versions of RStudio have Quarto pre-installed, making it much easier to work with Quarto files and projects. Older versions rely on RMarkdown. You can also learn more about the latter in the “7. Getting started with R Markdown” section of the “R for Social Scientists” course.\n\nNavigate to the “Get started” tutorial on the Quarto website and work your way through the first page. That should be enough to get you started out using Quarto. You can watch the full video tutorial and work your way through the rest of the pages outside class.\nCreate a new .qmd document for “Lab 2” with a few basic items in it (some section headings, some text, a code block; you haven’t yet learnt any useful commands in the R language to write in the code chunk, but you can use R as a simple calculator too, so come up with some simple mathematical calculations that you want the code to evaluate and give you the results for). Your end product would look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Tabulate categorical variables\nMost of the variables in the dataset are categorical, so tabulating the frequency distributions of their categories can come handy. There are various ways for doing this in R, but one of the most convenient options is to use the data_tabulate() function from the datawizard package.\nLet’s look, for instance, at the “generalised social trust” variable, Q57:\n\nwvs7data |&gt; data_tabulate(Q57)\n\nLet’s decipher the code above:\n\nfirst, we assume that there is an object called ‘wvs7data’ in our Environment that contains the WVS7 dataset; unless we restarted RStudio or deleted it, the object should still be there from the previous exercise;\nthe |&gt; (or %&gt;%) operator (called a pipe) allows objects and functions to be fed (i.e. piped) forward to other functions. The %&gt;% “pipe” originates from the user-written package magrittr and was widely adopted in the tidyverse. The |&gt; version is a new native operator introduced in recent versions of R. It looks a bit simpler than the original pipe, and it behaves somewhat differently (we won’t get into that here). The Windows Rstudio keyboard shortcut to insert the pipe character is Ctrl + Shift + M, which by default inserts the original version. You can change the RStudio settings to insert the native version instead. If you get to use RStudio more, you may want to do this (in the RStudio Menu bar, go Tools &gt; Global Options…, click Code and then tick the box “Use native pipe operator”). Getting into the habit of using the “pipe” workflow is particularly useful as it makes combining a series of operations/commands easier to read and follow. Here, we take our dataset and pipe it forward so that we can easily refer to variables from that dataset (such as Q57);\nthe remaining code applies the data_tabulate function to the variable Q57\n\nWe could have written the command in these ways, with the same result:\n\ndata_tabulate(wvs7data, Q57)\n\ndata_tabulate(wvs7data$Q57)\n\nThe first approach above takes the general form function_name(dataframe_name, variable_name), which some tidyverse-based functions allow. The second one follows base-R’s general form of function_name(dataframe_name**$**variable_name), using the $ operator. Here, wvs7data**$**Q57 extracts the Q57 variable/column from the wvs7data dataframe object.\nWe will aim to follow the |&gt;/%&gt;% “piped” workflow whenever possible, because it’s more flexible to expand and reads more logically to humans. However, the $ “extract” notation is ubiquitous and many functions that depend of base-R require it, so it’s worth being aware of it.\nThe resulting frequency table will be printed in the Console, and will look something like this:\n\n\nMost people can be trusted (Q57) &lt;categorical&gt;\n# total N=94278 valid N=93005\n\nValue                      |     N | Raw % | Valid % | Cumulative %\n---------------------------+-------+-------+---------+-------------\nMost people can be trusted | 22552 | 23.92 |   24.25 |        24.25\nNeed to be very careful    | 70453 | 74.73 |   75.75 |       100.00\n&lt;NA&gt;                       |  1273 |  1.35 |    &lt;NA&gt; |         &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nInterpret the table:\n\n\n\nHow many of the respondents in the data think that “most people can be trusted”?\n\n\nWhat is the percentage of those who are less trusting of others?\n\n\nAre there any missing values (NA) on this variable?"

    "text": "Summarize numeric variables\nThere are much fewer numeric variables in this dataset (and in sociological datasets in general). One that we have is age (Q262). The base-R function summary is enough to get a basic summary of a quantitative/numeric type variable. Base R functions, however, don’t always work with a pipe ( |&gt; ) workflow; summary doesn’t, so we must use the $ operator:\n\nsummary(wvs7data$Q262)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n  16.00   30.00   41.00   43.41   56.00  103.00     510 \n\n\nThere are various other options available too in different packages. For example, the below is the default output from the describe_distribution() function from the datawizard package which is part of the easystats ecosystem that we already installed and loaded:\n\nwvs7data |&gt; describe_distribution(Q262)\n\nVariable |  Mean |    SD | IQR |           Range | Skewness | Kurtosis |     n | n_Missing\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ262     | 43.41 | 16.58 |  26 | [16.00, 103.00] |     0.40 |    -0.71 | 93768 |       510\n\n\nThe describe_distribution() function also allows us to change the measure of “central tendency” that we want reported. The easiest is to request “all” available measures of centrality available for the given variable type:\n\nwvs7data |&gt; describe_distribution(Q262, centrality = \"all\")\n\nVariable | Median |   MAD |  Mean |    SD |   MAP | IQR |           Range | Skewness | Kurtosis |     n | n_Missing\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ262     |     41 | 19.27 | 43.41 | 16.58 | 30.03 |  26 | [16.00, 103.00] |     0.40 |    -0.71 | 93768 |       510\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nInterpret the outputs:\n\n\n\nWhat is the average (mean) age of the respondents in the dataset?\n\n\nWhat about the median age?\n\n\nHow spread out is the age of the respondents?\n\n\nIs the variable skewed in any direction?\n\n\nWhat is the minimum and maximum age of the respondents?\n\n\nAre there any missing values on this variable?\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few statistics in the outputs above that may be less straightforward:\n\nthe 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu. refer to the 1st and 3rd quartiles (i.e. the 25th and 75th percentiles), respectively. Half (50%, i.e. 75%-25%) of the values in the variable fall between these two values. The range of values between the two is also known as the interquartile range (IQR), and it’s a similar measure of spread/dispersion of the data as the standard deviation (SD) or the variance (the square of the SD), but more robust against outliers.\nthe MAD refers to the median absolute deviation, another measure of data dispersion. It is the median of the absolute values of the deviations of each data point from the data’s median.\nthe MAP (for Maximum A Posteriori probability estimate) is effectively an equivalent of the mode for numeric/continuous variables.\nthe skewness and kurtosis of a distribution is easiest to evaluate visually, but there are rules of thumb for evaluating the statistics; if the skewness value is roughly between -0.5 and 0.5, the distribution is approximately symmetric; values between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1 reflect moderate negative or positive skewness, respectively; if the skewness is lower than -1 (negative skewed) or greater than 1 (positive skewed), the data are extremely skewed. Similarly, kurtosis values greater than 3 denote a leptokurtic shape (peaked, with thick tails), values below 3 a platykurtic (flatter) shape, and values around 3 denote a roughly normal distribution. The values of -0.71 thus means a strongly platykurtic (flat) distribution. We can get a better sense of what this means by looking at a visual description of the variable’s distribution."

    "text": "Visualising distributions\nIt is often useful to make a graph to visualise a variable, especially a numeric variable. A figure can often convey information in a much more efficient way that a statistic/number. One of the most useful graph types for visualising numeric variables is a histogram. There are many functions available in R for producing graphs. Once you become more proficient and use R more often, it is very useful to learn the graphing workflow of the ggplot2 package (included in the tidyverse), which builds up a graph canvas step by step using various elements. That allows the creation of highly customized figures of publishable quality.\nFor quick graphs, base R also has good plotting functionality with simple commands. A histogram of age could be called with:\n\nhist(wvs7data$Q262)\n\n\n\n\nAn equivalent chart using ggplot2 functions requires more steps:\n\nggplot(wvs7data) +         # start a blank canvas with the data\n  aes(x = Q262) +          # add an \"aesthetic\", i.e. the variable(s) we want to visualise\n  geom_histogram()         # add a \"geometric object\", i.e. the type of graph we want \n\n\n\n\nIf you see a cryptic warning message that a number of “rows containing non-finite values” have been removed, in this case that refers to the missing values (NA) on the age variable (compare to the summary statistics you produced earlier).\nThe ggformula package can be a useful choice if you want to combine the ease of expanding the graphs in more complex ways with a command structure that will become more familiar once we start modelling relationships between variables.\nAll the plot calls in the ggformula package start with gf_, and they require a “formula” style input. The command would be:\n\ngf_histogram( ~ Q262, data = wvs7data)\n\n\n\n\n# or #\n\nwvs7data |&gt; gf_histogram( ~ Q262)\n\n\n\n\nThis function has a similar structure to the functions that we will use for statistical modelling, generically of the form goal(y ~ x, data = my_data). In our case, we are only “modelling” one variable here, so the first (y-axis) object before the tilde (~) is missing. The data can be specified with the option data = ..., or in a “piped” workflow.\nDensity plots are also useful for this purpose:\n\nwvs7data |&gt; gf_density( ~ Q262)\n\n\n\n\nCategorical variables are best visualised using bar charts. For example, a bar chart of the “generalised trust” variable:\n\nwvs7data |&gt; gf_bar( ~ Q57)\n\n\n\n\nIf we are not interested in the missing (NA) values, we can eliminate them as part of the plotting function:\n\nwvs7data |&gt; \n  drop_na(Q57) |&gt; \n  gf_bar( ~ Q57)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we could combine the two graphs that we have created so far, faceting the histogram of age by the categories of the “generalised trust” variable. To do this, we add the categorical variable after a vertical bar (|):\n\nwvs7data |&gt; \n  drop_na(Q57, Q262) |&gt; \n  gf_density( ~ Q262 | Q57)"

The exercise explores the relationship between inequality and generalised trust at the national level in international comparison. The aim is to assess the arguments put forward by (Wilkinson and Pickett 2010) in their Chapter 4. Their measurement of generalised trust comes from the World Values Study (1999-2001), while for the measure of inequality they use the so-called “S80/S20” measure, which is the ratio of the average income of the 20% richest to the 20% poorest people in a country. We have similar data obtained from the latest waves of the World Values Survey and European Values Study (2017-2022) and the World Bank. To ensure that inequality data is available for as many countries as possible, I calculated the “S80/S20” measure as the average of the data available in each country between the years 2010-2022.\nThe dataset can be loaded into R directly from the module’s github repository:\n\ninequality &lt;- data_read(\"https://github.com/CGMoreh/SOC2069/raw/main/Data/for_analysis/lab3macro.rds\")\n\nWe can check the list of variables in the dataset and their first few values with the data_peek() function from datawizard:\n\ndata_peek(inequality)\n\nData frame with 89 rows and 10 variables\n\nVariable      | Type      | Values                                     \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\ncntry_AN      | character | AL, AZ, AT, AM, BA, BG, BY, HR, CZ, DK, ...\ncountry       | character | Albania, Azerbaijan, Austria, Armenia, ... \ntrust_pct     | numeric   | 2.52, 30.36, 48.46, 17.68, 9.61, 18.05, ...\nGDPpercap2    | numeric   | 12770.9918634405, 14121.4069355591, ...    \npop           | numeric   | 2873457, 9854033, 8797566, 2851923, ...    \nurban_pop_pct | numeric   | 59.383, 55.343, 58.094, 63.103, 47.876, ...\ninc_top20     | numeric   | 39.6375, NA, 38.4181818181818, 39.575, ... \ninc_bottom20  | numeric   | 7.9125, NA, 7.90909090909091, ...          \ns80s20        | numeric   | 5.00947867298578, NA, 4.85747126436782, ...\nRegion        | character | Europe & Central Asia, ..."

(tip: the standard deviation (SD) is a good measure of “spread”, or variation around the mean)\nWhat is the minimum and maximum percentage of the urban (versus rural) population in individual countries in the data? Do you think this value is correct, or might there be something wrong with the data? How would you explain this distribution? (tip: check the dataset itself to explore the individual data points; you can open it in a viewer window by double-clicking on the data object in the Environment, or using the View() function)\nAre there any missing values (NAs) on any of the variables in the dataset?\nHow would you describe the distribution of the population variable?\n\n\nAs we have practised in Lab2, we can also tabulate factors and character variables with the data_tabulate() function.

    "text": "Describe the relationship between your variables\nTo visualise the relationship between two numeric variables we can use a scatterplot. Relying on the ggformula package we got to know in Lab2, we can use the gf_point() function. We keep in mind that our response variable is generalised trust and the explanatory variable is inequality. So it is customary to place the response on the y axis and the explanatory (predictor) variable on the x axis, in line with the general formula notation y ~ x. The command is the following:\n\ngf_point(trust_pct ~ s80s20, data = inequality)\n\n\n\n\nTo add a linear regression line to the scatterplot we can use the gf_lm() function:\n\ngf_point(trust_pct ~ s80s20, data = inequality) |&gt; \n  gf_lm()\n\n\n\n\nThe straight line we plotted is a regression line that visualises the linear model \\(\\hat{y} = a + bx\\) (see Agresti 2018: 250-252; Gelman et al. 2020: 37-38, 82-95). In Step 4 we will fit this model statistically to obtain the values for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients so we can interpret the regression line more accurately. For the moment, let’s rely on our eyes.\nOne thing to notice immediately is how the y-axis has expanded into negative values. This is because the linear assumption of the regression line means that at high values of inequality very low, below-zero values of trust are predicted, even though that is not logically possible, given that our measurement is on a percentage scale (i.e. running between 0 and 100).\nTo constrain the y axis to the actual values of our data, we can set limits on the scale using the gf_lims() function:\n\ngf_point(trust_pct ~ s80s20, data = inequality) |&gt; \n  gf_lims(y = c(1, 80)) |&gt; \n  gf_lm()\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nDoes the graph show a negative or positive correlation?\nDoes the graph show a strong or weak correlation?\n\n\nAnother addition to the chart that may come useful are value labels, in this case the names of the countries; this would allow us to identify which are the outliers. We can use the gf_text() function for this, with some additional specifications to set the size of the labels and their distance from the value points:\n\ngf_point(trust_pct ~ s80s20, data = inequality) |&gt; \n  gf_lm() |&gt; \n  gf_lims(y = c(1, 80)) |&gt; \n  gf_text(label = ~ country, size = 2.5, hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.15, nudge_y = 0.15)\n\n\n\n\nWe may wonder whether a linear function is really appropriate for our data, and we could replace the linear model line with a smoothed line that follows the shape of the data more closely:\n\ngf_point(trust_pct ~ s80s20, data = inequality) |&gt; \n  gf_smooth() |&gt; \n  gf_text(label = ~ country, size = 2.5, hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.15)\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, while it is apparent that the relationship between inequality and trust is not completely linear, the curvature is not too extreme.\nFinally, we may wonder whether there are any group effects in the data that are being missed in the bivariate plot. We could add a third variable to the plot by using colouring. Below, we use the Region variable a third grouping variable (notice the ~ sign when adding the colour aesthetic):\n\ngf_point(trust_pct ~ s80s20, data = inequality, color = ~ Region) |&gt; \n  gf_lims(y = c(1, 80)) |&gt; \n  gf_lm()\n\n\n\n\nBy adding a third variable to our visual model, the linear regression line also breaks down by Region and we can see more clearly that the effect (and indeed the direction) of inequality on trust is not the same within each regional grouping; in some regions the association is very steep and negative, while in others is flatter - or, in the case of “Middle East and North Africa” it is strong positive association.\nThis hints to an important limitation of correlations and simple bivariate regressions. It is often the case that third (and further) variables can have a very strong influence on the associations we observe, and we need to pay careful attention to disentangling the meaning behind our regression results."

    "section": "Fit the statistical model",
    "text": "Fit the statistical model\nSo far we have only visualised the relationship between inequality and trust, but we haven’t build a statistical model to obtain the coefficients describing the relationship. We already know from the scatterplots that a linear model may not be the ideal approach for our variables, but it is a very simple model that is worth starting with. In R, we can use the lm() function to run a linear model. Because we often want to have access to various components of the models we fit for further analysis, it’s recommended to always save the model results to an object. Let’s call out first model m1.1:\n\nm1.1 &lt;- lm(trust_pct ~ s80s20, data = inequality)\n\n\nCoding tip: Understand and simplify the formula\nClick to view\nThe lm() formula echoes the mathematical equation we are fitting:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n  \\color{Blue}{\\widehat{generalised\\:trust}} &\\color{Grey}{=} \\color{Red}{a} \\color{Grey}{+} \\color{Red}{b}\\color{Grey}{\\times}\\color{Blue}{inequality} \\\\\n  \n  \\color{Blue}{trust\\_pct} &\\color{Grey}{\\sim} \\color{Red}{1} \\color{Grey}{+} \\color{Red}{b}\\color{Grey}{\\times}\\color{Blue}{\\text{s80s20}}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nWe have data on the blue components (our two variables) and we are searching for the corresponding coefficients for the red components. The \\(a\\) is called the “intercept”, referring to the point where the regression fit line we plotted earlier on the scatterplot intercepts the \\(y\\) (trust) axis when the \\(x\\) (inequality) axis equals 0. The \\(b\\) is called the slope (visually, it’s the angle between a completely flat horizontal line and the regression fit line) and it tells us the observed difference between different countries’ values of \\(generalised\\;trust\\) when their levels of \\(inequality\\) also differ by one unit.\nThe intercept is included in the lm() function by default, so we don’t need to explicitly write it. We also don’t have to explicitly write data =, we can simply write just the name of the dataset. Our function call could be simplified to:\n\nm1.1 &lt;- lm(trust_pct ~ s80s20, inequality)\n\nHowever, leaving out data = does not work for all formula-style functions, so until you become very used to writing these commands, it’s better to spell out more than the strictly necessary. Also, remember that it’s more important to be accurate and to make it easy for yourself and others to understand your code easily.\n\n\nWe can see that the object “m1.1” now appears in the Environment pane, and if we expand it we see a list of different elements (“coefficients”, “residuals”, “effects”, etc.). The “coefficients” are the most elementary and most important elements. We can print them by using the coefficients() function or simply coef():\n\ncoef(m1.1)\n\n(Intercept)      s80s20 \n  45.384383   -3.114425 \n\n\nAs noted in the Coding tip above, the two coefficients that we see here for (Intercept) and s80s20 are the corresponding values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), respectively, in the \\(\\hat{y} = a + bx\\) equation. We can substitute them - rounding down to two decimal places for simplicity - to obtain the equation: \\(\\widehat{trust} = 45.38 - 3.11\\times inequality\\). So what does this mean?\nWe said at the start that the aim of a linear regression model is to help us predict the value of generalised trust from that of inequality; i.e. what would our best guess concerning a country’s population’s level of trust be if the only information we had about that country was its level of inequality? Knowing a country’s inequality score is already more information than not knowing anything. Without information on inequality our best guess would be simply the overall mean (i.e. average) trust score for the whole dataset. If we remember from the descriptive statistics we’ve done earlier in the exercise, the mean of the trust variable was 25.73.\nWe can actually obtain the mean of a numeric variable also by using the lm() function without any predictors specified. Let’s check the mean trust score using this method and compare it with what we got from the summary statistics earlier:\n\nlm(trust_pct ~ 1, data = inequality) |&gt; coef()\n\n(Intercept) \n   25.73056 \n\n\nThe coefficient is exactly the same as the one we got from the descriptive statistics we did in earlier steps. So, without knowledge of a country’s inequality level, or any other further information, our safest guess of a national population’s trust level would be 25.73. However, in knowledge of a country’s inequality, the slope (\\(b\\)) coefficients we got from the regression tell us that the best guess is the intercept (45.38) plus -3.11 times the country’s inequality score. For example, our best guess for the generalised trust score of a country with an inequality score of 5.4 in our dataset would be:\n\n45.38 + (-3.11 * 5.4)\n\n[1] 28.586\n\n\nMore generally, the model tells us that a 1-unit difference in inequality is associated with a 3.11-unit difference in generalised trust as measured here.\n\nRemember how we said earlier that the Intercept is the point where the regression fit line intercepts the \\(y\\) axis when the \\(x\\) axis is 0? This may sound okay visually, but note that in the case of our variables this means that the Intercept refers to the value of trust when the inequality variables is equal to 0. Mathematically, there’s nothing wrong with this, but in practice we don’t have countries scoring “0” on inequality in our dataset - in fact, a S80/S20 income quintile share ratio of “0” would not make much sense at all. In other words: the interpretation of the Intercept value is meaningless in our case. That doesn’t affect the slope coefficient, so our regression equation is useful for predicting from, but we should not interpret the Intercept as it is.\nIn order to make the Intercept more meaningful, one common approach is to mean-centre the predictor variable(s). In our case, we would “shift” the inequality scale so that the average (i.e. mean) inequality takes the value of “0”. The mean s80s20 inequality score in the dataset is 6.5, so using the mean-centred variable in the regression would make the Intercept refer to the value of inequality for the countries with an average income quintile share ratio; of course, there may not exist such a country in the dataset, but the value itself is theoretically possible within the context of our measurement.\n\nTo request a more detailed summary of the model results, the base R function to use is summary():\n\nsummary(m1.1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = trust_pct ~ s80s20, data = inequality)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-27.263 -12.432  -3.831   7.003  44.597 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The model_parameters() and the model_performance() functions from the parameters package part of easystats is a better option:\n\nmodel_parameters(m1.1) \n\nParameter   | Coefficient |   SE |         95% CI | t(77) |      p\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |       45.38 | 5.21 | [35.01, 55.76] |  8.71 | &lt; .001\ns80s20      |       -3.11 | 0.74 | [-4.60, -1.63] | -4.18 | &lt; .001\n\n\nmodel_performance(m1.1)\n\n# Indices of model performance\n\nAIC     |    AICc |     BIC |    R2 | R2 (adj.) |   RMSE |  Sigma\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n676.482 | 676.802 | 683.590 | 0.185 |     0.175 | 16.854 | 17.072\n\n\nWe will learn more about the inferential statistics included in these model results (the standard error, the 95% confidence interval, the t-value and the p-value) later, once we are more confident with fitting and visualising regression models and interpreting the coefficients. For now, it’s enough to note that they are all related statistics testing the level of confidence that we can have in the generalisability of our results given the characteristics of our sample.\nThe statistics obtained from the model_performance() function, on the other hand, describe the model overall and purport to aid with comparing the “performance” of different models. The R2 value (more precisely \\(R^2\\), R-squared) is called the coefficient of determination and measures how well a linear model predicts the outcome, representing the proportion of variation in the response variable that is predicted by the explanatory variables; in our case that’s 0.185 or 18.5%. That’s a reasonable proportion, but not nearly close to explaining all the variation in levels of trust, highlighting that there are various other factors also at play apart from inequality, both at the national and the individual levels."

    "text": "Standardizing the modelled variables\nAs mentioned earlier, centring our variables around the value “0” so that regardless of their measurement scale the value “0” becomes a meaningful number can be useful and help interpretation. Furthermore, if we constrain our descriptor variables to the same scale, then they become more easily comparable. Of course, we only have one descriptor variable at the moment, but that’s always just an initial phase in a real analysis project. The way we can constrain variables to a comparable scale is through standardization. A standardized variable (sometimes called a z-score or a standard score) is a variable that has been rescaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\nTo standardise a numeric variable, we can use the standardize() function. Let’s create a new standardised version of the s80s20 variable and save it as a new variable in the dataset:\n\ninequality &lt;- inequality |&gt; \n  data_modify(s80s20_std = standardize(s80s20))\n\nWe can plot the new variable:\n\ndescribe_distribution(inequality, s80s20_std)\n\nVariable   |     Mean | SD |  IQR |         Range | Skewness | Kurtosis |  n | n_Missing\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ns80s20_std | 9.13e-17 |  1 | 1.07 | [-1.15, 3.90] |     1.67 |     3.50 | 79 |        10\n\n\ngf_histogram( ~ s80s20_std, data = inequality)\n\n\n\n\nWee see that the mean of the new variable is very close to 0 (9.13e-17 is just scientific notation for a very small and therefore very long number; it tells us to move the decimal point 17 places to the left to obtain the number), and the standard deviation is precisely 1.\nIf we were to refit the regression model with this variable, we would get:\n\nlm(trust_pct ~ s80s20_std, data = inequality) |&gt; \n  model_parameters()\n\nParameter   | Coefficient |   SE |          95% CI | t(77) |      p\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |       25.13 | 1.92 | [ 21.30, 28.95] | 13.08 | &lt; .001\ns80s20 std  |       -8.09 | 1.93 | [-11.94, -4.24] | -4.18 | &lt; .001\n\n\nIn this case, we find that the average value of trust for a country with an average (0) level of inequality is 25.13 (Intercept), while countries with a 1 standard deviation higher inequality than the average are expected to have a trust score that is 8.09 units (percentage points) lower than the average. Although the units of measurement have changed, the actual proportions of the effects we observe have not changed. We have made the intercept value meaningful, but the units by which we measure inequality are no longer the same. A standard deviation is a much larger unit than the units of the original scale, so a 1-unit change in inequality now translates into a larger effect.\nWe could also standardize the response variable in the same way and refit the model with all the modelled variables in standardized format:\n\ninequality &lt;- inequality |&gt; \n  data_modify(trust_std = standardize(trust_pct))\n\nm1.2 &lt;- lm(trust_std ~ s80s20_std, data = inequality)\n\nmodel_parameters(m1.2)\n\nParameter   | Coefficient |   SE |         95% CI | t(77) |      p\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |       -0.03 | 0.10 | [-0.24,  0.17] | -0.31 | 0.754 \ns80s20 std  |       -0.44 | 0.11 | [-0.65, -0.23] | -4.18 | &lt; .001\n\n\nThe interesting thing about this output is that the coefficient we get for s80s20_std is the same (within rounding error) as the correlation coefficient (r) between s80s20 and trust_pct. To check the correlation between two numeric variables, we can either use the base-R function cor.test():\n\ncor.test(inequality$trust_pct, inequality$s80s20)\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  inequality$trust_pct and inequality$s80s20\nt = -4.184, df = 77, p-value = 7.527e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.5948878 -0.2312889\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n-0.430389 \n\n\nOr the cor_test() function included in easystats:\n\ncor_test(inequality, \"s80s20\", \"trust_pct\")\n\nParameter1 | Parameter2 |     r |         95% CI | t(77) |         p\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\ns80s20     |  trust_pct | -0.43 | [-0.59, -0.23] | -4.18 | &lt; .001***\n\nObservations: 79\n\n\nThe easystats ecosystem also has a convenience plot() function that creates quick plots from various summary functions, including cor_test():\n\nplot(cor_test(inequality, \"s80s20\", \"trust_pct\"))\n\n\n\n\nA correlation is nothing more (or less) than a bivariate regression with both variables standardized. Its coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of the association between two numerical variables. In this case, we observe a negative correlation between inequality and trust of medium strength.\nFrom the regression model we obtained a related statistics, the coefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\)), which is the square of the correlation coefficient ($-0.4304^2 = $0.1852347)."

The model that is being summarised is an Anova model (or analysis of variance) and its results are very similar to what we would obtain from a linear regression using the lm() function:\n\nm1.3 &lt;- lm(trust_pct ~ Region , data = inequality)\n\nmodel_parameters(m1.3)\n\nParameter                           | Coefficient |    SE |          95% CI | t(80) |      p\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept)                         |       33.10 |  4.25 | [ 24.65, 41.55] |  7.80 | &lt; .001\nRegion [Europe & Central Asia]      |       -2.06 |  4.93 | [-11.88,  7.75] | -0.42 | 0.677 \nRegion [Latin America & Caribbean]  |      -22.17 |  6.37 | [-34.85, -9.50] | -3.48 | &lt; .001\nRegion [Middle East & North Africa] |      -20.68 |  7.20 | [-35.01, -6.36] | -2.87 | 0.005 \nRegion [North America]              |       11.52 | 12.38 | [-13.11, 36.15] |  0.93 | 0.355 \nRegion [South Asia]                 |      -13.85 | 10.40 | [-34.55,  6.85] | -1.33 | 0.187 \nRegion [Sub-Saharan Africa]         |      -24.02 |  9.25 | [-42.44, -5.61] | -2.60 | 0.011 \n\n\nLook at the regression results closely and compare it with the results from the Anova model in th previous table.\nThe logic of the linear regression model is different. As we know from the previous exercise, the coefficients represent a comparison between different values or levels of the explanatory variable. In the previous exercise, the comparison was to a unit difference in the level of inequality; here, R has recognised that Region is a categorical variable and has broken it down into a series of indicator/dummy/binary variables, one for each category of the region variable. Then, these individual binary indicator variables were intered into the regression model, effectively turning it into a multiple regression model with six predictors. The first category of the Region variable (“East Asia & Pacific”) appears to be missing. However, if we look closely, we notice that the mean value of “East Asia & Pacific” that we got in the previous summary table and the value of the Intercept in the regression model are the same. That’s because in the linear regression model results the “East Asia & Pacific” category was “absorbed” into the intercept - it became the “reference category” to which all the other categories compare.\nAs in the models in the previous exercise, the Intercept is purely the average value of the response variable trust_pct when the value of the explanatory variables(s) is 0. In our case, if the values of each of the six regions listed in the model are equal to 0 (i.e. a country does not belong to them), then the Intercept shows the average trust value of the remaining region (“East Asia & Pacific”). The other coefficients in the table are just the difference between the average trust in the reference category (“East Asia & Pacific”) and the other region. For instance the value of -1.66 associated with “Europe and Central Asia” means that the average trust of the countries in this region is \\(33.10 + (-1.66) = 31.44\\), which is precisely the mean value that we saw in the means_by_group() table.\nWe can in fact remove the Intercept from the model by adding a column of 0 to the regression model like so:\n\nm1.4 &lt;- lm(trust_pct ~ Region + 0 , data = inequality)\n\nmodel_parameters(m1.4)\n\nParameter                           | Coefficient |    SE |         95% CI | t(80) |      p\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRegion [East Asia & Pacific]        |       33.10 |  4.25 | [24.65, 41.55] |  7.80 | &lt; .001\nRegion [Europe & Central Asia]      |       31.04 |  2.51 | [26.05, 36.03] | 12.38 | &lt; .001\nRegion [Latin America & Caribbean]  |       10.93 |  4.75 | [ 1.48, 20.37] |  2.30 | 0.024 \nRegion [Middle East & North Africa] |       12.42 |  5.81 | [ 0.85, 23.99] |  2.14 | 0.036 \nRegion [North America]              |       44.62 | 11.63 | [21.48, 67.76] |  3.84 | &lt; .001\nRegion [South Asia]                 |       19.25 |  9.49 | [ 0.36, 38.14] |  2.03 | 0.046 \nRegion [Sub-Saharan Africa]         |        9.08 |  8.22 | [-7.28, 25.44] |  1.10 | 0.273"

The Intercept still represents the average trust value when the explanatory variables hold the value 0. In this case, it represents the average trust of a country in “East Asia and the Pacific” with 0% of its population living in cities and with an income quintile share ratio of “0”. As with the first model, such a country cannot exist in reality, so the Intercept value should not be interpreted. However, the \\(b\\) slope values of the other coefficients can be interpreted as the difference in the trust value when the variable takes on a value that is one unit higher (in the scale on which the variable is measured), while taking into account the effect of the other variables included in the model.\nWe find that the inequality variable still has a negative and notable association with trust even after accounting for differences in urbanization and world region."

The dataset should already be downloaded and available in your module data folder. Let’s import the data into R, but first, it’s worth highlighting some options that need bearing in mind when importing labelled data of the kind that comes from social surveys:\n\nIt’s important to note that by default the data_read() function assumes that numeric variables where all values have a value label are categorical and will convert them into factors. That means that all the numeric “values” will be replaced by the “value labels” (e.g. 1=“Yes”/ 2=“No” will become simply “Yes”/“No”). This is usually a reasonable default behaviour, because the majority of functions in R do not handle “value labels” and working with textual (character string) values can be more explicit. However, this may be less appropriate when the dataset contains many long ordered variables (such as 0-10 scale items), as we will most likely want to treat such variables as numeric in statistical models.\nTo cancel this default behaviour, we can add the additional argument convert_factors = FALSE into the data_read() function. This is the format of the variables as listed in the Codebook on the module website (https://soc2069.chrismoreh.com/data/data_main), with both “Values” and “Value labels” kept as in the original survey questionnaire documentation. This is also the format that gets imported when using readRDS(). However, most of the common tabulation and graphing functions will not show the category “labels” in the output either, and for that purpose having variables “converted to factors” (with the original “Values” overwritten by the “Value labels”) may be a better option.\nBelow we will import the data without converting to factors.\n\n# Change the file path to the one on your computer!\n\nwvs &lt;- data_read(\"D:/GitHub/SOC2069/Data/for_analysis/wvs7.rds\", convert_factors = FALSE)\n\n# or #\n\nwvs &lt;- readRDS(\"D:/GitHub/SOC2069/Data/for_analysis/wvs7.rds\")"

We can do this by browsing through the WVS7 codebook (https://soc2069.chrismoreh.com/data/data_main#wvs7-codebook). If our aim is to stay as close as possible to (Wu 2021)’s analysis, we can also read the sections of the paper where they describe their choice of variables:\n\nFor the WVS, I use the standard survey item asking, “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people? (Rosenberg 1956). The variable is coded on a 0 to 1 scale, with 1 corresponding to high levels of trust.” (p. 1170)\n\n\nFor the WVS, I measure educational attainment using respondents’ highest education level attained with eight categories, namely, 1 = no formal education or inadequately completed elementary education, 2 = completed (compulsory) elementary education, 3 = incomplete secondary school: technical/vocational, 4 = complete secondary school: technical/vocational, 5 = incomplete secondary: university, 6 = complete secondary: university, 7 = some university without degree, and 8 = university with degree/higher education.\n\n\nIn some analyses, I treat education as a categorical variable. To reduce the number of categories, I recode respondents’ education into Primary, Secondary, Post-secondary, and Tertiary. This is also consistent with the most recent wave of the WVS coding (p. 1171)\n\n\nI also control for relevant demographic covariates such as gender, age, income, marital status, and occupational status at the individual level (p. 1172)\n\nBased on the above description, the most appropriate variables available to us in the WVS7 dataset are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWVS7, selected variables (94278 rows and 7 variables, 7 shown)\n    \n\nID\n      Name\n      Label\n      Type\n      Missings\n      Values\n      Value Labels\n      N\n    \n\n\n\n1\nQ57\nMost people can be trusted\ncategorical\n1273 (1.4%)\n1\nMost people can be trusted\n22552 (24.2%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nNeed to be very careful\n70453 (75.8%)\n\n\n2\nQ275\nHighest educational level: Respondent [ISCED 2011]\ncategorical\n1012 (1.1%)\n0\nEarly childhood education (ISCED 0) / no education\n4708 (5.0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nPrimary education (ISCED 1)\n11101 (11.9%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nLower secondary education (ISCED 2)\n14082 (15.1%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nUpper secondary education (ISCED 3)\n23880 (25.6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nPost-secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED 4)\n8367 (9.0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nShort-cycle tertiary education (ISCED 5)\n7818 (8.4%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nBachelor or equivalent (ISCED 6)\n16133 (17.3%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nMaster or equivalent (ISCED 7)\n6076 (6.5%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nDoctoral or equivalent (ISCED 8)\n1101 (1.2%)\n\n\n3\nQ260\nSex\ncategorical\n95 (0.1%)\n1\nMale\n44403 (47.1%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nFemale\n49780 (52.9%)\n\n\n4\nQ262\nAge\nnumeric\n510 (0.5%)\n[16, 103]\n\n93768\n\n\n5\nQ288\nScale of incomes\nnumeric\n2928 (3.1%)\n1\nLower step\n7078 (7.7%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nSecond step\n5344 (5.9%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nThird step\n10339 (11.3%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nFourth step\n12847 (14.1%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nFifth step\n21949 (24.0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSixth step\n14108 (15.4%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nSeventh step\n10643 (11.7%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nEight  step\n5504 (6.0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\nNineth step\n1706 (1.9%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\nTenth step\n1832 (2.0%)\n\n\n6\nQ273\nMarital status\ncategorical\n577 (0.6%)\n1\nMarried\n52028 (55.5%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nLiving together as married\n7489 (8.0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nDivorced\n4256 (4.5%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nSeparated\n2082 (2.2%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nWidowed\n5427 (5.8%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSingle\n22419 (23.9%)\n\n\n7\nQ279\nEmployment status\ncategorical\n1186 (1.3%)\n1\nFull time (30 hours a week or more)\n34071 (36.6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nPart time (less than 30 hours a week)\n7972 (8.6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nSelf employed\n13309 (14.3%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nRetired/pensioned\n11961 (12.8%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nHomemaker not otherwise employed\n12388 (13.3%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nStudent\n5219 (5.6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nUnemployed\n7073 (7.6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nOther\n1099 (1.2%)\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nIf we decide that these are all the variables that we will need for our current analysis, we can shrink the wvs dataframe to these selected few columns to make it cleaner to work with.

    "text": "Step 2: Recoding and renaming variables\nBefore we proceed with the analysis, we will need to make some alterations to our variables. Our data is generally tidy, but some adjustments are needed:\n\nVariable Q57 will serve as our response (dependent) variable - the one we which to explain/model. We can see from the frequency table that it has two valid categories (“1” and “2”), which we can read off from the codebook table that they refer to “Most people can be trusted” and “Need to be very careful”, respectively. Given that it is a binary (dichotomous) variable, we will use binary logistic regression to model it. When we enter a variable into a logistic regression model as dependent variable in R, the first category/level will be automatically recoded internally to the value “0” and be used as the reference category; the latter category/level will be recoded to “1”, and it will be the indicator category that the model predicts in contrast to the reference category. In our case, that will mean that the category referring to “Need to be very careful” will be treated as the indicator variable by default, so effectively the coefficients of the explanatory (predictor, independent) variables will be estimating the propensity towards “distrust”. If we first reversed the order of the categories in the dependent variable, the model would be estimating “trust”, which is conceptually cleaner and more straightforward to interpret.\nFollowing (Wu 2021), we will treat our main explanatory variable - Q275, Highest educational level - as numeric. But it in the dataset it is coded as factor, so we should change that. Technically, the education variable is categorical in nature, but given that it has 9 levels/categories (0 to 8) and there is a clear ordering in the levels running from low education to high education, we can conceptually treat it as numeric, which makes it easier to use a single scale (with a mean, standard deviation, etc.)\n\n(Wu 2021) also noted that in some models they used a recoded categorical version of the education, reduced to 4 categories: “Primary”, “Secondary”, “Post-secondary”, and “Tertiary” education. We can also create this variable to potentially include it in our models\nFinally, while we’re at it, we can also rename our variables to have more human-readable names than the original ones.\n\nWe can achieve all of the above in a single call to the datawizard function data_modify() like this:\n\n\nex1 &lt;- ex1 |&gt;                                                                       # (1)\n  data_modify(trusting = reverse(Q57),                                              # (2)\n              educ_num = as_numeric(Q275),                                          # (3)\n              educ_cat = recode_values(Q275,                                        # (4)\n                                       recode = list(\"Primary\" = (\"0, 1\"), \n                                                     \"Secondary\" = (\"2, 3\"), \n                                                     \"Post-secondary\" = (\"4, 5\"),\n                                                     \"Tertiary\" = (\"6, 7, 8\"))),    # (4.1)\n              sex = Q260,                                                           # (5)\n              age = Q262,\n              income = Q288,\n              marital = Q273,\n              employment = Q279)                                                    # (6) \n\n# Code explanation:\n# (1) overwrite the data object with the changes\n# (2) reverse the category order of \"Q57\" and save it as a new variable called \"trusting\"\n# (3) change the type of variable \"Q275\" to numeric and save it as the new variable \"educ_num\"\n# (4) recode the \"Q275\" variable into 4 larger categories and save the new variable as \"educ_cat\"\n# (4.1) make sure to close all the brackets under `recode_values()`\n# (5) rename the remaining variables as \"newName\" = \"oldName\"\n# (6) remember to close the brackets under `data_modify()`\n\nOf course, we could do all the changes one-by-one, but because we can achieve everything we wanted using the data_modify() option, it’s easier to do it all at once. When you are experimenting with recoding, it is probably a good idea to do it one-by-one and check the results at each step to catch out any errors more easily.\nLet’s have a look at the recoded dataset; because we did not overwrite any of the original variables, we will have both the old and the newly recoded/renamed variable in the dataset, but we will be referring to the new variables from

Since the education variable is now recorded as numeric, we can make use of a boxplot for visualisation:\n\ngf_boxplot(educ_num ~ trusting, data = ex1)\n\n\n\n\nWe can see a slightly higher median education level among those responding that “Most people can be trusted” (category “2”). For a more detailed numerical summary of this association, we can use another function that we know from Lab3, means_by_group():\n\nex1 |&gt; means_by_group(\"educ_num\", \"trusting\")\n\n# Mean of Highest educational level: Respondent [ISCED 2011] by Most people can be trusted\n\nCategory                   | Mean |     N |   SD |       95% CI |      p\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNeed to be very careful    | 3.38 | 69831 | 1.97 | [3.36, 3.39] | &lt; .001\nMost people can be trusted | 4.09 | 22286 | 2.07 | [4.07, 4.12] | &lt; .001\nTotal                      | 3.55 | 92117 | 2.02 |              |       \n\nAnova: R2=0.023; adj.R2=0.023; F=2159.726; p&lt;.001\n\n\nHere we can see more clearly the difference in average education levels between those with high trust levels and those with low trust levels. We also know from Lab3 that this table is equivalent to the results from a linear regression model in which the numeric variable educ_num is the dependent variable and trusting is the explanatory (independent) variable.\nHowever, we are interested here in modelling the trusting variable as a function of education, while also accounting for the other demographic covariates. For this, we turn to a logistic regression model."

    "section": "Step 4: Fit and interpret a simple bivariate logistic regression model",
    "text": "Step 4: Fit and interpret a simple bivariate logistic regression model\nFitting a logistic regression model is fairly simple. We can use the base R glm() function and would write the following code:\n\nm1 &lt;- glm(trusting ~ educ_num, data = ex1, family = binomial)\n\nIn the code above, instead of the linear model function (lm()) we used the generalised linear model function (glm()), and because glm() is a larger family of models, we need to also specify which “family” we are fitting; since our dependent variable is binary variable, we are calling the “binomial” family. In all other aspects the formula is the same as the one we already know from linear regression.\nLet’s look at the model parameters:\n\nmodel_parameters(m1)\n\nParameter   | Log-Odds |       SE |         95% CI |       z |      p\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |    -1.80 |     0.02 | [-1.83, -1.76] | -105.85 | &lt; .001\neduc num    |     0.18 | 3.86e-03 | [ 0.17,  0.18] |   45.46 | &lt; .001\n\n\nIt is at the stage of interpretation that logistic regression models become difficult. The coefficients that we obtain in the standard output are similar to those from a linear regression in that they summarise a linear and additive relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The difference is that the dependent variable has been transformed to a logit or logged odds scale. We could say - following the logic of linear regression - that each unit difference in one’s education level is associated with a 0.18-point positive difference in the logged odds/logit value of trusting. But this doesn’t make much sense, because the logit scale is difficult to comprehend. It would be more intuitive to see the results on a different scale, such as odds or probabilities.\nIf we exponentiate the logistic regression coefficients, we could say that the independent variables relate to the odds of the dependent variable, rather than the logged odds, which is somewhat easier to relate to. The model_parameters() function can do that for us in exchange of some additional specification:\n\nmodel_parameters(m1, exponentiate = TRUE)\n\nParameter   | Odds Ratio |       SE |       95% CI |       z |      p\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |       0.17 | 2.81e-03 | [0.16, 0.17] | -105.85 | &lt; .001\neduc num    |       1.19 | 4.60e-03 | [1.18, 1.20] |   45.46 | &lt; .001\n\n\nThe odds ratios that we find in this table are somewhat easier to interpret, but we need to understand how odds work. By having exponentiated the coefficients, we have moved from an additive scale to a multiplicative scale. Basically, what this means is that while on an additive scale the value “0” means no change (because by adding 0 to a number we don not alter the number), on a multiplicative scale that role is taken over by “1” (when we multiply a number by “1”, we keep it as it is). Consequently, a coefficient of “1” on the exponentiated scale means no difference, while values between 0 and 1 represent a negative difference and values greater than 1 a positive difference. I our case, the coefficient of 1.19 means that a difference of one degree in education level is associated with a positive difference of 1.19 in the odds of being A trusting person. We could further translate this into a percentage: if we subtract 1 from the exponentiated coefficients and multiply it by 100, we get the percentage difference due to a unit change in the independent variable.\n\\[\n\\% \\Delta _{odds} = 100\\times(OR-1)\n\\]\nFor values grater than 1 this calculation is very straightforward. In our case, this translated to a 19% increase in the odds of being a trusting person.\nIt doesn’t add much to our understanding to plot the regression results from a model with a single predictor, but knowing how to plot results will be particularly useful once we expand the model with further explanatory variables. To create a plot of the results, we can simply take the output from the model_parameters() function and pass it on to the plot() function:\n\nparameters(m1, exponentiate = TRUE) |&gt; plot()\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the fact that the exponentiated coefficients are measured on a multiplicative scale poses some difficulties and it makes it easy to fall into the trap of interpreting these odds as probabilities. The issue is that odds can range from 0 to infinity, so the scale is far from standard. Probabilities, on the other hand, have the nice feature of being constrained between 0 and 1, so a percentage change has much more meaning.\nThere are several packages that help us compute various comparative statistics on the probability scale from logistic models. Below, we will use the avg_slopes() function from the marginaleffects package to compute the average difference in the probability of being trusting based on a one-unit difference in education level:\n\navg_slopes(m1)\n\n\n     Term Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(&gt;|z|)   S  2.5 % 97.5 %\n educ_num   0.0314    0.00067 46.9   &lt;0.001 Inf 0.0301 0.0327\n\nColumns: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high \nType:  response \n\n\nThe result tells us that that probability is just over 3%.\nTo make these numerical results easier to understand, we can plot the result. There are several options, but probably the most straightforward approach is to estimate the probabilities of being trusting at each level of the predictor variable (education). The plot_predictions() function from the marginaleffects package or the plot() function of ggeffects can be used here. Below, we’ll use the latter:\n\nggpredict(m1, \"educ_num\") |&gt; \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\nThis code first calculates predictions of the outcome probability for each level of the explanatory variable using the ggpredict() function (we could save these results as a data-frame), then passes those results on to the plot() function. To remove the overlapping value labels on the horizontal axis,, we could add something like the following to the command:\n\nggpredict(m1, \"educ_num\") |&gt; \n  plot() +\n    scale_x_continuous()\n\n\n\n\nThis graph makes it a lot clearer how education is associated with trust in our model, and if education is our main variable of interest, we can plot its effect even from a larger model that contains other covariates."

    "text": "Interpreting interactions\nAs with results from logistic regression models, interpreting interaction results is not straightforward.\nFirst of all, the coefficients associated with the individual variables included in the interaction term can no longer be interpreted in the usual direct way, and we usually no longer interpret the “main effects” of educ_univ and trusting, but only the multiplicative effect of the interaction between them. The interpretation of the numeric results, however, is rather convoluted and prone to lead to misinterpretations. In essence, what we get is the effect of a unit-change in trust among the university-educated compared to the effect of a unit-change in trust among the non-university-educated.\nAs with interpreting logistic regression, it can be much easier and reliable to interpret a plot of the “marginal effects”. As we already know from Lab 4, that can be achieved using the ggpredict() and the plot() functions, and we would add both constitutive terms of the interaction. Depending on which variable we write first we get either the effect of trust by education, or the effect of education by trust:\nEducation by trust:\n\nggpredict(m5.1x, terms = c(\"educ_univ\", \"trusting\")) |&gt; \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\nTrust by education:\n\nggpredict(m5.1x, terms = c(\"trusting\", \"educ_univ\")) |&gt; \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\nThe latter plot reproduces Figure 1 from Akaeda (2023). To get an even closer reproduction of that Figure, we could add an additional argument to the plotting function, asking for the point-predictions to be connected with lines:\n\nggpredict(m5.1x, terms = c(\"trusting\", \"educ_univ\")) |&gt; \n  plot(connect.lines = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nLooking at whether and how much the confidence intervals of the predicted coefficients overlap with the point-predictions of the coefficients, we can visually asses the interaction effect. We find that positive differences in the level of social trust have a much steeper effect on redistributive attitudes among the highly educated than it does among the lower educated.\n\nPractice interpretation\nHow does Akaeda (2023) discuss their findings in respect to social trust? Read the relevant sections in the journal article and attempt to write down our own findings along those lines."

The assignment is a quantitative research report based on an original piece of research. The focus will be on quantitative analysis skills, but to complete the report you will need to situate the findings from the statistical analysis within existing literature on the broad topic of the research question.\nSetup\nDownload the Assignment template folder from Canvas and open the assignment1_template.qmd file.\nRead through the descriptive text in the template file.\nChoose a research question\nYou can select one of the optional research questions or come up with your own research question based on the variables available in the assignment datasets.\nCheck the example analysis\nFor inspiration on how to get started, you can check the example analysis on Canvas. There is also a video recording running through the example analysis. The example contains some advice on how to best render certain table outputs produced by the datawizard package to Microsoft Word output format using the print_md() function.\nInterpret results from the regression model(s)\nBased on the work from previous worksheet exercises, the lectures and the methodological readings, you should have developed by now some level of confidence with interpreting regression results. However, interpretation takes a lot of practice. To improve your interpretation skills, the easystats package provides some useful functions. Specifically, the report package includes functions that print out an interpretation of an analysis object. The most general function is report().\nYou can call the report() function on any model object. For example, if you follow through the example analysis, you will have produced a linear model object called model1. You can call the report() function on this object like so:\n\nreport(model1)\n\nThe results that you get will be the following:\n\n\n\nWe fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict anti_immigrant with ppltrst, eduyrs, agea and gndr\n(formula: anti_immigrant ~ ppltrst + eduyrs + agea + gndr). The model explains a statistically significant and\nweak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.10, F(4, 35537) = 964.62, p &lt; .001, adj. R2 = 0.10). The model's\nintercept, corresponding to ppltrst = 0, eduyrs = 0, agea = 0 and gndr = 1, is at 6.71 (95% CI [6.58, 6.84],\nt(35537) = 104.58, p &lt; .001). Within this model:\n\n  - The effect of ppltrst is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.23, 95% CI [-0.24, -0.22],\nt(35537) = -46.72, p &lt; .001; Std. beta = -0.24, 95% CI [-0.25, -0.23])\n  - The effect of eduyrs is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.08, 95% CI [-0.09, -0.07],\nt(35537) = -24.99, p &lt; .001; Std. beta = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.14, -0.12])\n  - The effect of agea is statistically significant and positive (beta = 9.11e-03, 95% CI [7.75e-03, 0.01],\nt(35537) = 13.18, p &lt; .001; Std. beta = 0.07, 95% CI [0.06, 0.08])\n  - The effect of gndr [2] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.08, 95% CI [-0.12, -0.03],\nt(35537) = -3.07, p = 0.002; Std. beta = -0.03, 95% CI [-0.05, -0.01])\n\nStandardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95%\nConfidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.\n\n\nYou can use this function to improve your interpretation of the statistical results, but do not include them in your report as it is. To develop your reporting skills, the best approach is to read again through the application readings to see how results from statistical analyses are reported in real research publicaitons.\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Timetable week: 7\nTopic: \"Observation: ethnographic fieldwork\"\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nUnderstand the principles and practice of asking research questions that are best addressed using an ethnographic approach\nDevelop skills for designing an ethnographic study focusing on observation and note-taking\nUnderstand the importance of field-notes and how to use them in practice\nIntroduction\nIn this lab we focus on ethnographic research and some of its main empirical tools: observation, participation and field-notes. The lecture provided a broad introduction to ethnographic practice and highlighted some examples using the lecturer’s own research. In this lab, you will discuss and critique some of the methodological aspects of two of the lecturer’s published articles, and using the assigned methodological readings you will design a short non-participant observational study to be carried out in the university library over the next few weeks. You will use the “field-notes” taken as part of this observational exercise in Week 10 (Interpretation: analysis and writing)\nExercise 1: Discussion and critique\nAbout 40  minutes\n\nWorking in groups of three, discuss and compare the methodological aspects of the two articles below:\n\nMoreh (2014) “Prestige and Status in the Migration Process: The Case of Social Differentiation in a Romanian ‘Community’ in Spain.” Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 40(11):1758–78. Available here: https://www.chrismoreh.com/publication/2014-jems/2014-jems-txt.pdf\nMoreh (2016) “Inhabiting Heritage: Living with the Past in the Albayzín of Granada.” Open Library of Humanities 2(1). Available here: https://olh.openlibhums.org/article/id/4416/\n\nThe development of the research projects that underpin these two articles was already discussed in the lecture, but here your task is to focus on how the methodology presented in the lecture comes across in the published results. These two articles are in no way meant to exemplify best practices in ethnographic observational research, but are purely meant as examples of how one researcher addressed two different research topics by using different approaches to ethnographic fieldwork. You are asked to put on your sharpest critical lens when reading and assessing the methodological approaches presented in these articles.\nFocus your group discussion on the following questions:\n\nWhat were the main ‘theoretical’ or ‘conceptual’ aims of the two articles?\nHow does the chosen methodology relate to the main research questions that the articles aim to address?\nHow does the author connect “methods” and “findings” in each of the articles?\nHow is “ethnographic” research carried out in the context of the two different projects? What are the differences? What are the similarities? What does this tell you about the multiplicity of forms that ethnographic research can take?\nWhat are your methodological criticisms of the articles? What would you have done differently if you were to design that research study?\nExercise 2: Planning an ethnographic study\nAbout 40  minutes\n\nIn a small group of 3 or 4, draw up a plan for a short ethnographic observational fieldwork to be carried out in the university library at various times over the next two weeks.\nFor this exercise, you will want to rely on all the readings assigned for this week. Particularly, Chapter 12 (**“Rigorous ethnography”,** by Federico Varese) in Gërxhani, Graaf, and Raub (2022) provides a good overview of how to undertake a rigorous ethnographic study, which requires careful planning while allowing to maintain your focus open and flexible to any emergent and unexpected questions, which is a core strength of ethnographic research. In Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw (2011) you will find detailed guidance on how to approach taking”jottings” and field-notes , a core element of data collection during ethnographic fieldwork.\nIn your planning, consider the following:\n\nCome up with a “research question” that you would like to focus your ethnographic observation on. This question can be anything, as long as the field site is the university library. You can think about a “group” you would like to study (e.g. students, library staff, etc), or a phenomenon (e.g. using the library for other purposes than purely “studying”), or a specific activity (e.g. interactions between staff and students at the reception desk), or anything else!\nThink about some “theoretical” of “conceptual” framework for your research question(s). This sounds more complicated than what it would look like in practice, but for this you can rely on other readings/theories from other modules that may apply. For example, the library can be perceived as an institutional site within a higher education institution, and the video about using Institutional Ethnography as a Qualitative Research Method to Explore Higher Education Institutions included in the Further resources describes how an “institutional” conceptual framework can be adopted.\nThink more carefully about when and how you will be conducting your observations. For example: What aspects of “library life” would you be focusing your observation and note-taking on? What methods would you be using for “jotting” down immediate observations and descriptions? Chapters 1 and 2 from Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw (2011) can be very useful for thinking through the various issues you may need to consider in advance of your fieldwork.\nExercise 3: Carry out a brief observational study\nOutside class\n\nIndividually, carry out the ethnographic observation that you planned in Exercise 2 over the next two weeks. Make sure to take many field-notes as you will be asked to bring them with you to the lab in Week 10, when we will practice analysing and writing up “findings” form qualitative data.\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nEmerson, Robert M., Rachel I.

    "text": "Aims\nSociology is based on systematic knowledge about the social world that we inhabit. ‘Researching Social Life I’ introduces the range of ways that sociologists do research by collecting empirical information so that they can develop their sociological ideas. Its core theme is the importance of evidence: the way we collect and analyse information has a huge effect on our research findings. Data analysis is a practical activity, and therefore the module is distinctive in involving a series of hands-on computer labs and seminars, as well as being focused on practical assignments. It is in these applied sessions that you will convert the principles explained in the lectures into skills, so that you too can carry out research. Although concerned to convey the systematic application of appropriate professional standards, the module also tries to communicate some of the excitement and fun of doing research. The module makes four main contributions to the degree program:\n\nIt lays a foundation of knowledge and critical awareness about how research gets done, which helps to appreciate and make sense of the other sociological sources used in the rest of the degree’s modules.\nIt enables the best choice of research methods to be made for doing your research for the Final Year Dissertation in sociology.\nMore generally, the informed and critical thinking learned in the module can also be applied to analyse what really lies behind media news-stories, politicians’ speeches, lobby groups’ reports on social problems – and even gossip – that we all encounter as citizens.\nFinally, because Research Social Life I delivers a substantial part of “what every sociology graduate can be expected to know”, having studied the subject, it offers the opportunity to acquire transferable skills for later employment in a range of professions. These include interviewing, analysing social behaviour, using computers to process quantitative information, where to locate data on public issues and how to apply them, and how to make sense of social surveys."

Interviews aim to elicit information from key participants in their own words. Such information can provide an in-depth understanding of participants’ lives, opinions, belief, or key events. Interviewing styles can also vary greatly, and they can be carried out either individually or in groups. There are numerous steps that a sociologist needs to cover when designing an interview-based research project. The lecture provided a broad introduction to some of the most important considerations, strategies and concepts in qualitative interviewing. In this lab, you will get the chance to read, think, and discuss about examples of sociological research carried out using interviews, and to design your own interview guides.\nExercise 1: Find qualitative and mixed-methods data on the UK Data Service\nAbout 20 minutes\n\nThe UK Data Service (UKDS) is the country’s largest data repository. It makes a variety of data available to UK researchers for secondary analysis, and we will be using data accessible through this repository throughout this module (and for the assignments!).\nIt is also useful to become acquainted with the variety of secondary data available there and the basic functionalities of the site, as you may decide to use secondary data for your final third-year dissertation.\nThe UKDS is available at this website: https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/\nBegin by exploring the options available under the Find data tab of the UKDS website. The Find data page contains a short video on How to use the UK Data Service catalogue search tool, which you can watch outside class. As we are just exploring the data offerings of the service, navigate to the Browse and access data page, where you can browse data by theme or type, among some other options. Most of the secondary data available is quantitative. But we can find some qualitative and mixed methods studies too, some of which have made their data (e.g. transcribed and anonymised interview data) available. Let’s choose to Browse by data type and select Qualitative/mixed methods.This takes us to the main data catalogue, where we can see that the search is filtered down to “Qualitative and mixed methods” in the Data Type field of the menu on the left. We can perform various selections using that menu, refining the search by date or setting other filters.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nHow many qualitative and mixed methods studies are available on the UKDA in total?\n\nClick to view answer\n\nAt the time of writing there were 1764\n\n\n\n\nTake some time to explore and become familiar with the page. Try to:\n\nFind the newest studies based on their date of collection (tip: check out Sort by)\nSearch a keyword of your own interest in the search field (Search our data catalogue) (e.g. ‘migration’, ‘gender violence’, or any topic you are currently interested in). How many studies did you find?\n\nYou may have found some studies that you find interesting based on their titles. You can have a closer look at them outside class, but because not all datasets are equally well documented and made available, let’s look at a few studies that I find particularly interesting and well-documented:\n\nStetka, Vaclav and Mihelj, Sabina and Toth, Fanni and Kondor, Katherine (2022) “The Illiberal Turn? News Consumption, Polarization and Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe, 2019-2020” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855088\nWrighton, Sam J (2021) “The Annexation of Populations: A New State Strategy, 2017-2021” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854598\nEinarsdottir, Anna and Mumford, Karen and Birks, Yvonne and Lockyer, Bridget and Sayli, Melisa and Jeep, Sudthasiri (2021) “LGBT+ Networks, 2017-2020” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855322\nPearce, Sioned and Fox, Stuart (2020) “Young people and Brexit 2017” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854031\n\nChoose one study from among the above and read through the details. Write down a few notes on the aims, methodology, etc. employed:\n\nWhat was the main aim of the study? (usually stated somewhere in the abstract)\nWhen was the study conducted and where?\nWhat kind of data was collected? (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, mixed, etc.)\nWhat was the sampling methodology?\nWhat were the methods of data collection?\nUnder what conditions are the data available? (tip: click on Access data) \\(\\rightarrow\\) read more about data access conditions here\n\n\nExercise 2: Example interview guide design\nAbout 30 minutes\n\nLet’s look at another study that used a variety of different methods and for which the authors have made their documentation available. So, before we start thinking about designing our own data collection tools based on the methodological readings assigned for this week, let’s explore how these may look like in practice.\nLet’s have a look at a study undertake at the London School of Economics called “EU Kids Online” (associated with a larger project “Global Kids Online”). The details of the project can be accessed at this site: https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/eu-kids-online.\nThe project description states that:\n\n“EU Kids Online is a multinational research network. It seeks to enhance knowledge of European children’s online opportunities, risks and safety. It uses multiple methods to map children’s and parents’ experience of the internet, in dialogue with national and European policy stakeholders.”\n\nThe technical report to the most recent wave of the project further details:\n\nIn the fourth wave, EU Kids Online IV, from 2017 to 2019, the network designed a second representative survey of children and online risks and opportunities. The survey was conducted in 19 European countries and targeted children aged 9–17 who use the internet.\n\nPrevious waves of data collection also included interviews and focus groups. We’ll look at all of these tools to think about their design choices. The authors provide a lot of information in a research toolkit section: https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/eu-kids-online/toolkit\nLet’s look at their interview guides available in the project’s qualitative toolkit: https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/eu-kids-online/toolkit/qualitative-research. The page contains a lot of valuable material that you are advised to look over outside class (such as the ethics form, consent forms, invitations to participate; the coding guides and examples are something we’ll be looking at together in lab in a following week). But for this exercise, open the Individual interview topic guide and the Focus group topic guide. Read through them and take a few notes of your observations.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nRelying on the readings from today, discuss how the interview and focus group guides achieve the aims of the research project. - What are the main differences that you notice between a survey questionaire and an ‘in-depth interview’ guide? - What do these differences tell you about the different aims of the two tools? - What do these differences tell you about the different approaches to analysing the data? - What special considerations do we need to keep in mind when designing a focus group guide as opposed to a ‘depth’ interview?\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Design your own interview guide\nAbout 30 minutes; work in small groups\n\nWork in small groups of three or four.\nYou have the following research question: How did people make their way from school into employment in the past? As part of this main question, there are several sub-questions that one can think of, for example: What choices were available to them; what factors drove their decision-making; were their choices influenced or informed by the people around them; was where they lived a factor; what did it mean to be ‘young’ then; and how did their social and leisure lives change (if they did)?\nAs part of this exercise, you will need to develop the research question into one that can be answered through an individual interview or a focus-group. Working together, develop a draft interview guide. Plan for a very short interview of between 15-20 minutes. You should discuss and consider the various issues and strategies discussed in the assigned readings from (Gerson and Damaske 2020).\nThink in more detail about the following:\n\nWhat exactly does the main research question and the sub-questions mean?\nWho could you approach for the interview? Each member of the group needs to clearly identify one or two family members or older friend who you can interview. Returning to the research question: list 3-5 points of interest (what information would you need to collect to answer this research question?).\nFrom there begin developing an interview guide. You also need to decide how many questions to include.\nOnce written, consider the flow of the questions. Are they okay in that order, or should they be re-ordered? Is there a logic to this?\nDiscuss your choices with the workshop leader.\nWhen reasonably happy with you guide, go through each question together discussing what kinds of answers you’d expect, on the basis of your sense of education/employment trajectories and/or your knowledge of the person in question.\nSave the finalised list and email it to each other in the group. You all will use the same list of questions to conduct a practice interview outside class, so make sure you have a copy!\nNow turn your attention to how you are going to do the interviews. Who can use their mobile to record the interview? Would the interview need to take place by phone? If yes, would you still be able to record it, or have to take notes? Help each other to think through this.\nEthics: Have a good read of the informed consent form (available to download from Canvas) and discuss it. Do you understand what it all means? You’ll need to send this to your chosen interviewee so they can read it in advance. And you’ll need to record their verbal consent as part of the interview.\nExercise 4: Conduct a brief interview\nOutside class\n\nUsing the guide you co-designed in the previous exercise, conduct this short semi-structured interview sometime over the next two weeks, following the detailed guidance provided in (Gerson and Damaske 2020) (Chapter 5). Keep the interview short (between 15-20 minutes). Transcribe the interview recording (if recorded) and bring your transcripts with you to the lab in Week 10 (TW15) (Interpretation: analysis and writing). There, you can use it as your primary material to practice thematic coding and qualitative analysis.\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nGerson, Kathleen, and Sarah Damaske. 2020.
