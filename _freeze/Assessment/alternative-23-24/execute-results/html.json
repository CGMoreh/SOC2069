To prepare for the task, you should revisit the IT lab worksheets from all the relevant weeks.\n\nYour task is to interpret the findings as completely as you can in the format of a brief report (2,000 words).\n\nThe outputs contain some information about the variables included in the analysis, but to gain a more complete understanding of where the data came from and how the variables were measured you should also engage with the surveyâ€™s webpage. Information about the survey will be provided.\n\n\n# Statistical results\n\nOutputs and further information will be posted here ahead of the resit period.\n\n",
