## Packages to use in the course

For all tidyverse: [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/)`;` but we'll only use functions from:

-   `dplyr`:
-   `ggplot2`:
-   maybe others?

For data import: [`rio`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html)

## Qualitative / mixed methods data sources

### Focus group studies

An LSE study called "EU Kids Online" (associated with a larger project "Global Kids Online") has a lot of useful information on development of research tools on their website: <https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/eu-kids-online/toolkit>. Data from the project is also freely available through UKDA.

In their [Qualitative toolkit](https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/eu-kids-online/toolkit/qualitative-research) we can find both **individual interview and focus group guides** and examples of **first-level and second-level coding**.
