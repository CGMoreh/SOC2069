## Introduction

Welcome to Researching Social Life 1. My name is Chris Moreh, your module leader.
You probably still remember me form last year's Knowing in Sociology, where in the second half of the module I introduced some of the methodological approaches that we will be looking at in a much more applied way here [^2].
Before I briefly introduce the module and the semester, here's a reminder that you can contact me at my e-mail address and you can see me at the advertised office hours during the course of the module.
