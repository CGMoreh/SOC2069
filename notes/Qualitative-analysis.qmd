Hello, all. So this is your final lecture of researching social life, SOC 2 0 6 9, the qualitative data collection and analysis component.

And this week we're going to be talking about how we analyze qualitative data.

So this will be relevant to you in your assignment, although the assignment for this module is really just a practice run.
So you won't be expected to do all of the things in relation to especially interpretation.
I'm going to talk about today. But the other things that I will talk about will be very much relevant to your dissertation.

And also this is just a kind of overview of how qualitative researchers analyze their data.
So I'll talk about several things in this lecture.
So first of all, what is data analysis, especially when we're talking about qualitative data, identifying themes?
Then we'll go back to the question about coding.
I know there's still a bit of confusion about coding, so hopefully we'll break some of that down as well.
Very briefly, I'll talk about using software, which is not something that you probably will want to do for this assignment,
but you might want to do for your dissertations or kind of going forward if you want to do more qualitative research.
And then I'll talk about how do you move from kind of coding and analysis of data to interpretation and argumentation from data.
So how do you actually construct an argument from your data?
Because that's often the thing that students find the hardest after they've mastered the coding part.
And then at the end, I'll talk a little bit about the assignment and just some reminders about what that's all about.
Okay. So what is data analysis?
Well, quite simply, it's about making meaning from data, and that's whether you're doing quants or qualitative data analysis.
So what do the data actually mean? So organizing your data, breaking it down into manageable chunks, searching for themes and patterns,
discovering what's important or unexpected, and then most most crucially,
kind of relating that back to your research questions, to the literature, to the theory and deciding how that you how you can write that all up.
So data analysis is a process and it often involves me moving back and forth between
your data and your theory or concepts between your data and your search questions,
between inductive and deductive reasoning. And if you can't remember what that means, I'll talk about that a little bit more in a minute.
And then between description and interpretation. So at some point, you need to move from describing what's in your data to exploring what that means.
So I want to share a quote from Whyte's book, Street Corner Society.
It was actually written in 1943. So before I was born, if you can believe that.
But it's still relevant, I think. And it goes like this often we have the experience of being immersed in a mass of confusing data.
We study the data carefully, bringing all our powers of logical analysis to bear upon them.
We come up with an idea or two, but still the data do not fall in any coherent pattern.
Then we go on living with the data and with the people until perhaps on chance.
Occurrence casts a totally different light upon the data and we begin to see a pattern that we have not seen before.
Once we think we see it, we must re-examine our notes and perhaps set out to gather new data in order to determine whether the
pattern adequately represents the life we are observing was simply a product of our imagination.
So this is about how data analysis is really about living with your data until patterns emerge.
It's very rare to read through a data set once and come up with an earth shattering, groundbreaking analysis.
You really have to live with that data and kind of start to get to know it and start to get to know some of the patterns and themes as they come up.
And only then will you notice what might be unexpected or what might be interesting about it.
And then when you have noticed those things, it's kind of going back then to your notes, to your research questions, your concepts,
4:23
and then back into the data in order to be able to tell if this is a genuine kind of pattern that
4:29
you've observed coming out of your data or whether it's something that's a little bit random.
4:36
So data analysis is kind of it's both intuitive and systematic, and you need to be able to do both.
4:41
And you need to kind of be comfortable with doing both.
4:50
So if you take a very logical kind of almost robotic approach to it, then you will not come up with anything interesting.
4:52
But it's also not appropriate to just sit down with your data. And think some thoughts and write them down.
5:00
You have to do both. So once you've kind of had a gut feeling about the data, then you have to try to systematize it.
5:05
If that makes sense. So most qualitative data analysis involves identifying themes.
5:13
So usually we'll be doing some kind of thematic analysis before we interpret our data.
5:24
And then we might write it up as a case study, as a comparison,
5:29
as a cross-section or some of the other types of design that we talked about in week one.
5:32
And this type of thematic analysis is very similar to the content narrative and discourse analysis we talked about in week three.
5:38
So it's really about deciding what the themes or what the concepts are under which you organize your data,
5:45
your label it, your sort it and you compare it.
5:52
And this is about, as we said in week three, it's about looking at the content and the context of the data.
5:56
So patterns in what he said, but also paying attention to how it's said and thinking about why.
6:04
And from this, you can develop different types of kind of data presentation.
6:12
You might have a typology,
6:18
you might have more of a kind of a look deeper into particular cases and you can start to generate arguments from your data.
6:19
So data analysis can normally have several stages.
6:26
So the pre analysis is where you read through your data, take the time to get familiar with your material.
6:29
And I just want to stop for a minute here and say you should do all this when you're doing your assignment,
6:36
even though it's a very small piece of data analysis. I would follow some of these steps or all of these steps.
6:41
Indeed, when you're doing your assignment and then you kind of know that you've done it in a systematic and proper way.
6:47
So pre analysis as where you read through the data, take the time to get familiar with it, read it more than once.
6:54
Think about what said how. Maybe start thinking about why.
7:00
So familiarizing yourself with the data at the start of your analysis is really crucial.
7:06
Otherwise, you'll just kind of be groping around in the dark and plucking out things at random,
7:11
and you'll probably miss a lot as well if you're not familiar with your data going forward for your dissertations.
7:15
If you've transcribed your data yourself, you'll have a head start on this.
7:22
If you've done interviews or focus groups and transcribe them yourselves, this is a really good way to get to know your data.
7:26
But if not, as with this assignment, you're working with interview transcripts that already exist.
7:34
You really need to start by reading them properly and several times and then creating a coding scheme as your next kind of step.
7:39
And this can be done inductively deductively or most probably through a mixture of both.
7:49
So deductive coding schemes are generated out of your search questions and theory.
7:57
So you look at research questions and theory and you come up with a list of themes that you want to look
8:03
for inductive coding schemes or where you just look into the data and see what emerges in practice.
8:08
Most people will do a mixture of both. So you might have a few themes that you identify you want to look at from your research questions,
8:14
but you might also want to stay open to new things and unexpected things that emerge for the purpose of your assignment.
8:22
Obviously you'll be doing inductive work, so you'll read through the interview transcripts, your kind of thing.
8:31
Okay. What are some of the things I notice? And then you create, you know, a set of codes of themes that you want to look for.
8:37
But as you go through and as you kind of rereading code up those transcripts, you you should allow other things to emerge as well.
8:45
So when you are creating a coding scheme, the task really is to identify what is recurring.
8:53
You know what? What themes are recurring?
9:00
What ideas are recurring sometimes what words are recurring, kind of what important words are recurring in the data.
9:02
You can also pay attention to what is not said. So obviously, you can't code for that, that you should pay attention to that as well.
9:09
And you can create main codes and sub codes, if you like. I'll talk about that a little bit more later.
9:16
So once you've created your coding scheme, you might have a few codes and for your for your assignment,
9:22
you know, you might only have four or five major themes that you want to look for.
9:28
And then you need to try out. So you code up your data. And again, I'll talk about different ways.
9:33
You can do that in a minute. So try it out. Try it your scheme, code up your data.
9:38
But all the time, be thinking of. Well, are things. Are there things here that I'm missing?
9:44
Are there things here which dont fit into my themes, which which feel quite important?
9:49
Because then the step after that is to adjust your scheme and try again.
9:54
So you might want to add a couple more themes or codes.
9:57
You might want to lose one if you think, well, this is something that's coming up a lot in the data,
10:01
but it's really obvious and we all know that already.
10:06
So I'm not going to code for that because it's kind of the obvious thing.
10:10
And then after you've adjusted your coding scheme, that's when you go back in and you really start to code up your data systematically,
10:14
improperly and again, I'll talk about different techniques for doing that in a minute.
10:20
So you need to really kind of go through and do this properly.
10:25
You need to document what you're doing. So write down the quotes or kind of pull out the quotes from the data page numbers or or
10:30
whatever you need to do so you can retrieve the information that you need to at any time.
10:37
So this is why you need to be really careful, really systematic and really thorough because it will it will save you time later.
10:43
And then after that, you will interpret your data. You'll write up your results.
10:50
Kind of step by step or section by section. And again, we'll talk about this more in the later part of this lecture.
10:54
So there are different types of themes that can come out during a data analysis.
11:03
So ordinary themes, which are the themes that you might expect.
11:08
And as I've said, you might decide not to code for some of those because it's too obvious or you might decide to code for them just so you've got it.
11:12
If you think you might use some of that data in your analysis, unexpected, you know,
11:20
the themes that are surprises and not, you know, you weren't looking for.
11:25
And sometimes those are the ones that you're really kind of go with in your data analysis.
11:30
The unexpected ones. And then they might be hard to classify.
11:35
You know, you might have a hard to classify theme in your data if you've got things in your data that you think,
11:39
well, that's important, but I can't really group it with anything else.
11:47
So you might kind of bung those all into a hard to classify your miscellaneous theme while you're coding so you can look at them later,
11:49
because sometimes, you know, you wouldn't necessarily make general points from those types of themes, but you might want to just mention them.
11:57
If they're particularly interesting, they might raise questions for further research on the topic, for example.
12:03
And then you might have kind of main themes and subthemes or main codes and sub codes or major and minor, you know, that kind of thing.
12:10
And I'm using themes and codes kind of interchangeably at the moment when I talk about a theme,
12:20
you can also call that code as your coding up your data, if that makes sense.
12:27
So let's talk a little bit more about coding. So coding is nothing more complex than categorizing and labelling your data.
12:35
There's a lot of jargon about coding that can be a lot of kind of technology around coding.
12:44
But really, it's a method of sorting, categorizing, labelling.
12:51
So you can extract those themes and those important points from your data later so you can write it up.
12:55
And as I've said, codes can come from theory and things outside of the data theory and research questions or they can emerge from the data.
13:03
And in practice, most people do a combination of both.
13:13
So you might start coding with themes identified from your research questions and theory.
13:16
Again, that's deductive, or you can let your code just emerge or you can do both.
13:21
So in practice, most of us will start with some codes from our theory and research questions and
13:30
then we'll add more as we're coding or we might change them as we're coding.
13:36
You can code your data as you go along. So when you're doing your dissertation, you might do 10 interviews.
13:41
I wouldn't start coding after you've just done one, but after you've done five, you might want to start coding just to kind of get a head start.
13:48
So you can do that and then add more data in. And obviously you might need to add new codes.
13:56
As you add new data, that's fine. Or you can start at the end.
14:02
So you can wait until you've done all your interviews with focus groups, read over and then code it all in one go.
14:05
As I've said already, coding should be continually under review.
14:13
So you should continually review your coding scheme.
14:18
Sometimes it's called a coding frame and adjust it if new things emerge or if you think actually I need to lose that.
14:21
It's not that interesting or important.
14:28
And most importantly, any new code you create should be applied to the whole dataset to say you've done five interviews.
14:31
You add a new one. Suddenly something new emerges, a new theme, a new code.
14:37
You need to then go back through those previous five and code them up with that theme.
14:42
If that makes sense, coding can start very descriptively, you know, and normally it does start very descriptively.
14:48
Just things, you know, tests. But you should always aim to become more analytical so you can do several rounds of coding
14:56
where you start with basic description and you move more into conceptual thinking as you go.
15:03
And you should also always record your thoughts and your ideas about your codes during the coding process,
15:10
because that's where your interpretation will come. That's where you will develop your argument from.
15:18
If something strokes, you write it down. If something surprises, you write it down.
15:23
If something makes you angry or upset, write it down. You know, all of this will help you interpret your data down the line.
15:27
So pay attention to your feelings. Pay attention to your gut.
15:35
When you're coding, sometimes you'll notice something, but you won't know why it'll stick in your brain.
15:38
You know, but you dont really understand why yet.
15:44
Really kind of pay attention to that, because these can often these insights can often turn into the most interesting findings.
15:46
Often the first story we tell about a dataset is the most obvious one.
15:53
So we need to wait until something new strikes us. And I'll talk about that when I talk about interpreting and writing up your data.
15:56
So there are different types of coding, so you can do kind of flat coding or non-hierarchical coding, which is a kind of a list.
16:06
So it's just, you know, a list of codes. There were no sub code levels.
16:15
So if you're doing research on friendships as an on the slide, you might have close friendships, sporting friendships and work friendships.
16:19
Those might be your flat codes. Another type of coding is hierarchical coding, also called tree coding.
16:26
So it's kind of a branching arrangement of codes and sub codes and codes in a tree should relate to their parents.
16:35
Sometimes you'll have child codes and parent codes,
16:42
so they might be examples of something or contexts for something or causes of something or settings for something.
16:46
And this is sometimes where you can start to get more analytical. So your main codes might start being quite descriptive,
16:54
but it's in your sub codes that you start to explore the how and the why or the where or or what have you.
17:01
So when you research on friendships, you'd have your three kind of flat codes, close friendships, sporting friendships and work friendships.
17:08
But in the sporting and the work, you're starting to get some sub codes.
17:16
So sporting friendships through clubs or non clubs,
17:19
work friendships which take place in the workplace or which might be with outside colleagues outside the workplace.
17:23
So you can kind of create a coding tree that is quite complex if that's something that you
17:30
think will work well for you and that's sometimes where your interpretation starts to emerge.
17:36
So codes should reflect the purpose of the research, so which reflect to research questions and they should also reflect what's in the data.
17:43
And sometimes these two things don't come together.
17:53
So sometimes your data, when you start analysing them, don't actually fit with your research questions.
17:55
You dont find what you think you might have found. And if this happens, please don't try to shoehorn your data into your existing research questions.
18:00
Change your questions. And there's nothing wrong with doing that when it comes to your dissertation.
18:10
That's not a failure.
18:16
That's actually a, you know, an example of successful research if you find things that you weren't looking for and change your questions.
18:17
But you must always be responsive to what's in the data and what the data are telling you.
18:24
So if you can't find the answers to your questions in the data, then think, OK, what questions is this data answering and ask those.
18:28
Obviously, you know, you need to pick the more interesting questions rather than the obvious ones as well.
18:37
As I've said already, in bigger projects, your codes should ideally be exhaustive.
18:43
So you you should ideally place almost all of your data in a category unless it's
18:50
incredibly repetitive and that way you'll know that you haven't missed anything.
18:55
Ideally, your code should also be conceptually congruent.
19:00
So be at the same level of abstraction or description because this makes the much easier to organize and analyze.
19:04
So in a in a project on on people's eating habits, for instance,
19:13
you wouldn't have produce canned goods and fruit as three separate codes because those don't work at the same level of description.
19:19
They're not kind of congruent with each other. Having said all that, there is no right way to code as long as your systematics.
19:29
So I'm gonna show you a few examples of ways to code. And just to give you a sense of the many different ways that you can do it,
19:36
but if you have a different system than you can use that, it's completely up to you.
19:43
So first of all, here's an example of some basic coding done by writing notes on a document.
19:49
This is often done at the first level of reading the data. So this is where you might kind of make some notes for your initial set of codes
19:55
or this might be what you do kind of completely and you might extract these later
20:03
on into electronic format to write them up or you might write them out in another
20:08
piece paper or however you want to do it again as long as it's systematic.
20:12
So that's a kind of very basic form of coding that you can do.
20:16
And you can see down the down the side there are, you know, some of the codes football,
20:20
jogging, age, injuries, weight gain, etc. And here there are notes as well.
20:25
Check other transcripts to see if age is a factor in how. So this is something maybe that's just been added as a code age.
20:31
So you need to then go back through your other interview transcripts to code for age as well.
20:38
Here's another example of kind of manual coding done using post-its and then cutting up your documents to populate the code.
20:46
So if that floats your boat, then you can do that kind of thing.
20:54
So the codes are on the Post-its and then you'll see in the second picture the documents have been kind of cut off.
20:57
Sometimes that's quite difficult. Do if people are mentioning more than one thing in a sentence or in a passage from an interview, but it is possible.
21:03
And if you'd rather not use kind of electronic equipment for your coding, then that's absolutely something that you can do.
21:11
And then this is an example of coding done electronically using different colour highlights and down the side.
21:22
There's the there's the codes with the highlight colours, identifying the codes.
21:28
You can do this with highlighter pens if you want as well. So you could do this as a manual coding method, too.
21:33
So.
21:39
This is a kind of quite common way of doing coding, using different colour highlights, and that might be something you want to do for this assignment.
21:41
And then this one I have shown you already. It's an example of coding done using comments in word.
21:52
So again, the the the text is highlighted in the code down the side.
21:58
And you can see that the codes are quite neat there. You know, just one word or two word codes, which is quite neat.
22:04
And again, you might need to then extract those manually to look at all of the information on the one particular code.
22:13
And then the last one. This is a more technical approach with highlighting and initials for each code.
22:23
So a code again, a code in the column to the right. But you'd need a key for these codes.
22:30
So what do these initials mean? And here is the key.
22:36
So this is something that you might want to do as well. So this is where you would describe the codes in a little bit more detail.
22:41
Also to remind yourself what the codes mean.
22:48
But it will also help when you write up your data, interpret your data.
22:52
So this is getting a bit closer to a kind of much more automated, much more technical method of coding.
22:58
And I just want to talk very briefly about using software. So do you need software to code?
23:05
Probably not for this assignment. Unless you're somebody who really likes using software and finds it kind of easy to use,
23:10
finds it helpful to use, or if you're somebody who wants to do a lot more qualitative research in the future,
23:19
perhaps for your dissertation, too, you might want to use software, especially if you're working with quite a lot of data.
23:26
So the advantage of software is that you can do much more advanced things with it.
23:32
So these codes that you've highlighted on your word document,
23:38
you can then extract all of the information related to a particular code together with its kind of context and look at that.
23:41
So it is handy, especially when you're working with quite big data sets, you can do all kinds of different organization of your data.
23:49
You can do charts. I like a chart. So those are some of the things that you can do with coding software.
23:59
If you are interested in software, then Newcastle University has a licence for NVIVO,
24:08
which is one of the more well-known qualitative data software packages.
24:13
So you can download a copy of this software onto your own machine, onto your own laptop or desktop at home.
24:19
You have to apply to get an activation code. I will put the information on the canvas if you want to apply or just have a little look.
24:28
And I will also put a link to some tutorials about how to use NVIVO.
24:39
We're not gonna go through this in this.
24:46
We're not gonna go through NVIVO in this lecture because I dont think very many of you will want to use it.
24:49
But there are some really good tutorials on the NVIVO Web site if you're interested in using it.
24:54
It's quite easy to use a very basic level. It's quite kind of what's the word intuitive to use a very basic level.
25:00
If you want to do more advanced things with NVIVO, then you will need to watch some of the tutorials and get some advice.
25:09
But if you just want to code up your documents and pull out the codes, then that's really quite easy to do.
25:15
There's other packages as well for qualitative analysis such as Atlas, which some people prefer to NVIVO. Quirkos is another one.
25:22
The university doesn't subscribe to those, but you can sometimes download free trial versions.
25:30
I know you can do about this.
25:36
You can code a certain number of transcripts up for free, or you can do a certain number of functions for free if you're interested in doing that.
25:38
So I'm happy to take questions about software if you want to email me and ask about it.
25:48
I'm not a massive expert on using software. I do use it, but I'm not kind of massively advanced user.
25:53
But I should be up to answer your questions. If you've got them or maybe refer you on to somebody who can help you.
26:01
I'm sure Audry is much more expert than me on using qualitative data software.
26:07
You might also want to ask her questions in the workshop if you're interested.
26:11
Okay, so that is analyzing coding your data and I hope that that has helped sort of allay some
26:17
of the confusion about what coding is and especially how to do it for your assignment.
26:26
I'm going to talk about the assignment again at the end of this lecture. But coding really isn't that scary or complicated.
26:31
It really is just organising and labelling.
26:37
But coding is only part of the data analysis process because you need to add your interpretation to the data.
26:39
So you need to think about the interconnections between your themes and codes, similarities and differences between different cases.
26:46
Maybe what is not said. You need to identify the significance of your findings to your research questions.
26:53
You need to relate your findings to the theory and to the research literature.
27:00
So all of that is part of your interpretation and writing up of the data.
27:04
And the simplest way to start with an interpretation is often by kind of plotting or mapping your themes in relation to each other,
27:10
then you can add in the subthemes that are emerging in relation to each of the
27:18
initial themes and and think about how the themes relate to the other themes,
27:22
and then you'll start seeing maybe the possible links or commonalities or
27:28
contradictions and differences between the different themes or cases in your data,
27:32
and then you can link them to the concepts or to the existing literature.
27:38
So it's really as a process of building mapping and kind of building up and adding in layers of interpretation as you go.
27:41
So this is already basic maths of some initial seems, some initial themes,
27:50
I've kind of gotten imaginary research project on victim blaming in sexual violence cases,
27:55
and I've got three different potential themes that might come out of a research project on that.
28:01
Obviously, this seems a completely obvious. So if you were doing a research project on this,
28:07
you'd need to search for something that was a little bit less obvious than what I've kind of just pulled out of my head.
28:11
But there's three different themes. The first one is the role of institutions such as the police and the media.
28:18
The second one is the role of rape myths.
28:24
And obviously that links in to those institutions because rape myths are kind of pervasive in those institutions.
28:26
And then a lack of community support is the third theme.
28:34
And then underneath those themes, I've started to think about, well, what might that relate to in the existing literature in the theory?
28:37
So role of institutions, police and media, you might look at the concept of power.
28:46
You might look at the role of the state as well. So that might be something that you start to build into your analysis of your data.
28:50
The role of rape myth, some in the obvious kind of thing to look up there is constructions of masculinity and femininity.
28:58
And similarly, in the community community support subtheme, you might look at something around social norms.
29:05
So why don't people kind of stand up? Why don't people speak out for those who are victimized in communities?
29:12
What are the norms? What are the kind of restrictions that stop them doing that?
29:21
And that might also be linked into the constructions of masculinity and femininity that also produce rape myths.
29:25
So you can see how the themes and subthemes are starting to kind of link together and you might want to draw some arrows on
29:30
that basic map of themes to kind of start showing where the interconnections are and help you as you start writing it up.
29:37
And also as you start to generate your interpretation of the data,
29:44
these initial themes might disappear because sometimes the most obvious way
29:49
of interpreting your data is not the most interesting way of writing it up.
29:54
So you might instead use your kind of more conceptual subthemes as your different sections or as your subheadings as you write up your data analysis.
29:59
So you might look at power than you might look at gender,
30:07
then you might look at social norms and those might be your three themes or you might do something different.
30:10
So it really is quite an iterative process as you start to analyze data and as you start to write it off, kind of think about, well,
30:17
what might be the most interesting way to read about this and what might be a way of writing
30:25
this up that doesn't kind of just direct people to the most obvious interpretation.
30:30
So you don't always write up your data with very descriptive headings or subheadings.
30:35
In fact, it's normally better not to do that. Okay, so if you kind of mind map to your themes like this,
30:41
you might then do something like this to incorporate your quotes or your passages from your data,
30:48
because when you write up your data, you need to find a good balance between presenting your data and narrating your data.
30:57
So you'll need to do a lot of work kind of introducing your themes and your subthemes, but then you'll need to illustrate those using quotes.
31:05
So this is a way that you might go through with your data analysis and kind of go, okay.
31:13
Theme one I've got, you know, the role of institutions. I've got, you know, these quotes, the evidence stuff and you might start to map those out.
31:17
So you know where to put things when you write it off.
31:24
So all of these are really different ways of organizing until you come up with a structure that you want to use in order to write up your data.
31:28
And when you do your assignment, it's eighteen hundred words, one thousand eight hundred words.
31:37
So you might only have, you know, two or three themes with maybe a couple of subthemes underneath.
31:43
And you should kind of do some mapping before you decide what those themes are going to be about.
31:50
The things that come out of the interviews for your assignment. You don't for this module.
31:55
You dont need to come up with something groundbreaking in earth-shattering.
32:00
This is really a kind of practice run and we're looking at the process of your
32:03
coding and the way you've approached your coding and then the way you've
32:09
written up your data with reference to some of the literature and there's literature available for you to look at with the assignment materials.
32:13
I'll talk about that again in a minute. I mean, if you can come up with something interesting or something a little bit unexpected, that's great.
32:21
But that's not the primary thing we're looking at. We're looking at your ability to actually code up that data, if that makes sense.
32:29
So I won't want to just finish by talking about how do we construct an argument from qualitative data.
32:39
So when you're sitting where the stack of narratives, you know, from interview transcripts or,
32:48
you know, it might be from your existing data that you've done,
32:52
content allows this on, as we talked about in week three, how do you shape them into something interesting and important?
32:55
So how do you construct a clear story without losing complexity?
33:03
How do you let people speak for themselves as much as you can while at the same time making an argument?
33:08
And this is really difficult and painstaking work writing up data and it often takes a few goes.
33:13
So what I'm going to talk about just for the last bit of this lecture and the infographic that's on the slide.
33:20
This is from our handout, which I've got on my blog, which is much longer, obviously,
33:25
which I'll put on the canvas alongside this lecture so you can go back in and read through it.
33:31
Some of the things in this are very much about kind of going forward with your dissertation.
33:37
So some of the ideas about originality and that kind of thing don't apply as much to this assignment because as I've said,
33:44
this assignment is really about doing the coding process.
33:51
But this will be useful when you think about your dissertations, because that really is about, you know, generating something a little bit fresh.
33:54
You know, it doesn't have to be the next grand theory of life, but you just want to do something a little bit different.
34:01
So interpretation and argument is what happens after data analysis.
34:09
Sometimes it has its roots within the data analysis or often that that will happen.
34:14
You'll start to generate your interpretation while you're analyzing your data.
34:18
So how do you make meaning from the data once you've synthesized it into categories or themes,
34:23
once you understood the patterns or the trends in the data? Once you've identified any particularly interesting or significant or unusual cases.
34:29
So what do you want to say about these data and crucially, why? Why do you want to say it?
34:37
So you need to really kind of take a breath at this point and think, okay, what is my project about?
34:43
So there are a number of different things that you should do at this point.
34:49
And the first one is to examine your interpret your motivations.
34:54
Sorry. So examine your motivations. So this is where we come to words like bias, which I dont really like because all all research is biased.
34:58
No research is objective.
35:09
But this is where we come to back to kind of back to full circle really to what we talked about in Week 1 on research design,
35:11
which is about being honest and systematic and thoughtful with your data.
35:18
So are you mining your data to find evidence for what you already think?
35:24
And if so, stop it. So you need to stop and reflect on your own position, ality any views that you hold particularly dear, you know?
35:30
Are you kind of you trying to work your own hobbyhorse here with this data?
35:40
As I've said, there's no such thing as unbiased, objective research. But we have to be as honest and thoughtful as we can.
35:45
And we have to honour that data really by by exploring what's in the data, not what we want to be in the data.
35:51
That makes sense. The second thing you must do and which students hardly ever do is go back to your rationale and your research questions.
So again, for this assignment, you won't have research questions, but for your dissertation, you certainly will.
And many students forget to go back to their rationale and research questions when they're interpreting and writing up their data.
So what did you originally want to know? Why did you want to do this study?
And if you find your data, answer different questions than the ones you started off with.
As I've said already, you can change your questions. That's absolutely fine.
But you need to have a conversation between a set of research questions and your data.
The next thing you need to do is go back to the literature.
So whether that's your theoretical framework, if you have one or the empirical literature on your topic or both, you need to think about how your data speak to the literature. So do your data confirm what's already been written?
Or are there new stories, other unanswered questions? Are there anomalies?
Are there contradictions that you can explore if you're using a particular theory?
Are your data consistent with that theory? Or do they expose any gaps in the theory or any gaps in how it can be applied?
And ideally, you need to be kind of finding gaps in the literature in order to fit your project into.
Before you start your data collection.
But you do need to go back to the literature and kind of being conversation with it and think about, okay, what what's there?
What does this data bring? That's new. Re-examine your concepts as well as.
Back to the literature. So what do these concepts look like in practice, in your data as you might have a lovely theoretical framework and then find that you're unable to actually apply it.
So you need to think really hard about what what your theory, how how you operationalize your theory and interpretation is often a process of shuttling between theory and data.
So you journey between one and the other.
And as you make these journeys, check that you're clear about the concepts you're carrying with you and how you're using them.
So, for instance, if you're looking for a concept such as power, what does it look like?
How will you identify that in your data?
So you need to start thinking, thinking about that and thinking systematically about how to apply your theory.
And then when you start to form an argument, you need to be kind of ongoingly honest about what your data actually support.
So when you come to do your dissertations, you might hear stuff about originality in your dissertation, which might might seem quite scary.
And sometimes the pressure for originality leads students to kind of overreach and make claims that are lovely.
They sound lovely, but they don't really bear much relation to the data set.
So beware that kind of armchair theorizing which is not grounded in your research.
It might be your pet idea, but are you sure you can evidence it?
And also be kind of be aware that the concept of originality is not as scary as you might think it is.
Originality really means just bringing something fresh. There is no such thing as a new idea.
Really, it's just kind of rearranging old ideas or maybe shedding new light on a particular thing.
Maybe putting two things together that haven't been put together before may be asking
slightly different questions or asking questions of a slightly different group of people.
So all of those things can kind of make for original research.
And if we go back to the research design lecture, you remember we talked about how you are contributing a piece or even part of a piece to a much broader jigsaw puzzle.
And that's what social research aims to do. So as long as you're clear what your little pieces may be,
it's that part of that cloud over there in the landscape, then you should be fine and kind of linked to that.
Know the difference between novelty and significance. So novelty is something we don't already know.
But we don't necessarily need to say. Here's an example of a novel research project.
It might be to interview women called Paula about how often the tomato ketchup.
I don't imagine anybody's done that before. This would be brand new information.
You could come up with some interesting new findings about how often women called Paula eat tomato ketchup,
but not necessarily that useful or significant.
So significance is something that challenges received wisdom in substantive ways or which kind of adds on evidence for a particular thing.
And again, it doesn't have to be ambitious. So knowledge advances in increments.
You've just got your little piece of the cloud on the jigsaw puzzle.
To develop something that is a bit significant usually requires quite a bit of shuttling between theory and data,
because as I've said already, the most obvious story about your data is not usually the most significant one.
So you need to kind of get the obvious stuff out the way first and then go back in and think, okay, what do I see now?
You know, what's what's emerging for me now? And doing that often means asking the why questions.
So why do we see particular trends or patterns in the data?
Why do we have this anomaly here, you know? Why do we have this contradiction here looking at any interesting cases in the data?
So there might be something which which isn't necessarily a dominant theme, but it's a kind of significant minority theme in your data.
And you might want to kind of look into that a bit more and then linked to that as well.
Ask yourself, so what you know, so going back to the women, call Paula eating tomato ketchup.
So what? Why do we care?
So how does your argument that you're developing food from your data shed light on something a bit bigger or something more important,
you know, broader economic, social, political issues? Why is it important?
Why do we want to know why do we care?
And then the last thing that I think is really useful when you're doing your data analysis is to write an abstract of your argument.
And you might want to do this for this assignment.
You know, sometimes it's just a nice thing to do, even when you're doing by small project of data analysis.
So try writing in abstract and an abstract if you don't know what one is.
It's a paragraph no more that summarizes the.
That you want to make, so if you read the journal article, they will have an abstract at the top of the article which summarizes the article.
So writing an abstract helps you to develop a narrative that's focussed and which makes logical sense.
So if you've got kind of several disparate themes and you don't know how they fit together,
writing an abstract can help you to try and figure out how they fit together.
And then as you write up your data analysis, keep your abstract handy,
because then you can kind of go back to it as you're writing up the data and stay focussed.

You can also amend your abstract as you're writing up the data. If something changes.








43:17
I'll put that longer blog on the canvas and you should read it at some point because it will help you in your third year with your
43:24
dissertations and it might also help you with this assignment just in terms of kind of the reflective process of coding and writing updater,
43:31
because part of the assignment is to reflect on the process. So for this assignment, obviously you won't have any research questions.
43:39
You could write yourself some if you want to.
43:47
If you read through, you know, your interviews, transcripts and think, okay, these are the questions I want to ask.
43:50
You can definitely write yourself some or you can just start with some themes or codes.
43:55
And as I've said already, we will not be looking for groundbreaking findings.
44:00
We will be looking for evidence of a systematic process of coding and some interpretation of the data.
44:05
So it's just a practice run. I'm going to go through the assignment details now.
44:11
At the end of this lecture, I dont think you can see my screen. I think you can just see the PowerPoint.
44:17
But where I am at the moment is I'm on the canvas site under modules.
44:22
If you scroll down underneath the first kind of little stack to assessment guidance, I'm in assessment one thematic coding and analysis.
44:28
This information is also available in the assessment booklet for the module, but the the data on available to download from there obviously.
44:37
So this assignment is due on Monday, the 22nd of November 12 noon.
44:47
You submit it via canvas and turn it in as normal.
44:52
And it's really a kind of practice run of coding. And to do this,
44:56
she'll be using interview transcripts from a real research project on young people
45:00
and Brexit conducted in 2017 by colleagues at Cardiff and Brunel Universities.
45:05
So on the canvass site and in the assessment booklet, you can click on a link to see more information about that project,
45:13
which I recommend that you do, because you that will give you a lot more information about the context of these interviews that you're looking at.
45:19
So these are interviews that they conducted with young people exploring their feelings about and responses to Brexit.
45:26
And the whole dataset is available to download from canvas.
45:33
And as I've said already, your task is to complete just some initial qualitative data analysis and to write it up,
45:37
which is worth 50 percent of your mark for the module.
45:44
So on the canvass site, you can download all of the interview transcripts as a zip file by clicking on the link from campus.
45:47
It should download to your computer. You should be able to just click on that zip file then and it will extract into a folder for you.
45:54
So you should choose just five or six of the interviews from the data set and no more of them read through the transcripts thoroughly.
46:02
Those five or six and you might want to skim through all of the transcripts or, you know,
46:14
at least some of the transcripts in order to pick the five or six that you want.
46:19
I'm just checking how many there are. So there are 18.
46:23
Not not that many. You might want to skim all of them or you might want to skim, say,
46:30
10 of them and then go back through and pick your five or six from the data set that you're going to code up.
46:34
Read through the transcripts thoroughly that you've picked.
46:42
So do the pre analysis part, you know, really carefully, because that will help you as you go through.
46:45
Then you need to code up the transcript.
46:52
So maybe you might identify a few themes kind of straight off and start coding and then kind of be open to some more themes that might emerge.
46:55
As you go code up the transcripts, you might again do an initial code through and then go back to your coding scheme and think,
47:05
okay, do I need to add or change anything and then go back through and do much more systematic coding?
47:12
You can use any methods you like, any of the ones that I've talked about in this lecture or something completely different.
47:18
As long as it's systematic.
47:23
So code them all up and then write up the analysis into a short essay on young people's feelings about and responses to Brexit.
47:25
You can use whatever title you like if you have a kind of a particular argument.
47:34
Want to make you can use that as your title.
47:38
If you don't have a particular argument, you can just use young people's feelings about and responses to Brexit as your title.
47:41
The themes that you choose to focus on in this essay should be the most relevant and or interesting in your dataset.
47:50
So you dont have to write up every single thing that you've identified,
47:56
especially not if you've got some fairly obvious ones that aren't really that interesting,
48:00
but right up you know your most interesting themes and subthemes and you should also include relevant quotations from your transcripts.
48:04
So as you code up the day to think about why the themes are important, you know, so what?
48:13
Why do we care? Any links or contradictions between themes or between subthemes?
48:18
Anything you can glean about the position narratives of the interviewee so gender, race, class, etc. and whether this is relevant.
48:24
And if you dont know that about the interviews, that's also fine.
48:32
And then think about how your analysis either supports, contradicts or extends the literature.
48:36
And when I say the literature, you dont have to do a full literature review.
48:43
You look at two or three sources from the list that I've provided, so I've provided a list of four journal articles that are all available online.
48:47
Look at two or three of them, or you can look for different ones if you want.
48:56
If you have other literature you want to use, that's also fine. The literature itself doesn't matter.
49:00
It's kind of what you do with it and how you relate it to your data.
49:05
So your essay should also include a short section on how you coded the documents and derive the themes and a reflection on how that was for you.
49:09
You know, so how did you find it? And also, how did your own position ality impact on your analysis?
49:18
So whether that's your gender identity or, you know, your ethnicity or your own views, any or all of that is relevant.
49:24
So your essay, as I've said, should be eighteen hundred words long, 1800 words long.
49:33
It should have a title, which I've talked about already.
49:40
You need an introduction and a conclusion. And in your introduction it would be useful if you could write a few sentences about the research project that the interviews have come from and what it was about in your conclusion.
49:50
You need to kind of summarize the argument that you've made from the data.
49:56
I would put subsections in not too many, but maybe a couple, a couple of subject subsections or, you know, subsections related to your themes.
50:00
So if you have three main themes, you might use three subsections, use the Harvard method of referencing.
50:09
So you need to reference the literature that you have used, but you don't need to reference your interview transcripts.
50:16
Those count as data, so they don't need to go into your bibliography.
50:22
So I hope that that's all clear and I hope that that seems doable to you.
50:28





1. Familiarization
During the first phase, you start to familiarize yourself with your data. If you have audio recordings, it’s often necessary to perform some form of transcription, which will allow you to work with your data. In this phase, you go through all your data from your entire interview and start taking notes, and this is when you start marking preliminary ideas for codes that can describe your content. This phase is all about getting to know your data.

How much you need to transcribe will vary depending on your project. If you are performing a broad and exploratory analysis, you may need to transcribe everything that was said and done during the interview, as you don’t know in advance what you are looking for. If you are searching for specific topics, you will probably only need to transcribe those parts of the interview that pertain to that topic. In some cases—e.g., when the interview is a minor part of a larger user test or observation project—writing a detailed summary or summarizing specific themes can be sufficient. When you consider how much to transcribe, take Braun and Clarke’s advice: “What is important is that the transcript retains the information you need, from the verbal account, and in a way which is ‘true’ to its original nature”.

Whether you transcribe it yourself or pay someone to do it for you will depend on your budget and your time. Some researchers prefer to do it themselves because they can start making sense of the data as they transcribe; others feel as though they can use their time more efficiently by reading the finished transcripts that someone else has made.

2. Generating Initial Codes
In phase 2, you assign codes to your data. A code is a brief description of what is being said in the interview; so, each time you note something interesting in your data, you write down a code. A code is a description, not an interpretation. It’s a way to start organizing your data into meaningful groups. As an example, let’s try to code a snippet from an interview about video streaming:

“I: So how did you find something?

Peter: Well, first she [his wife] looked at HBO and suggested that we watch ‘Silicon Valley’, but I’m not really into comedy shows. So, then she went to Netflix and suggested different movies, but there wasn’t really anything that I felt like… but then I remembered that we had been watching ‘Better call Saul’ before the summer holiday, and I couldn’t really remember if we had watched all the episodes, so we looked it up and it turned out that we had stopped in the middle of the season; so, that’s what we watched…”

You can give this section multiple codes (and it’s perfectly fine to give one section multiple codes) depending on your interests. If you are interested in different streaming services, you could use the codes “Netflix” and “HBO”. If your interests are broader or if you are—e.g.—interested in how people collaborate, you could use the code “coming to an agreement”. So, which codes you use depend on what is being said and on the purpose of your research. Your coding also depends on whether you are performing an exploratory analysis, where the themes depend on the data, or a deductive analysis, where you search for specific themes.

There is no clear cut-off between phase 1 and phase 2, and initial coding often takes place during the familiarization phase. There is specific software for coding, but you can also code by taking notes on a printed transcript or by using a table in a Word document. The most important thing is that you can match the code to the section of the interview that it refers to. Once you have coded all your data, the next step is to collate all the sections that fit into each code—e.g., collate all sections in your interviews with the code “Netflix”. If you are using pen and paper, you will have to copy sections that have multiple codes so that you can place them in more than one code category. If you are coding digitally, you can just use copy-paste. Braun and Clarke recommend that you code for as many potentially interesting themes as possible and that you keep a little of the data surrounding your coded text when you do the coding; that way, you won’t lose too much of the context.

3. Developing Themes
Whereas codes identify interesting information in your data, themes are broader and involve active interpretation of the codes and the data. You start by looking at your list of codes and their associated extracts and then try to collate the codes into broader themes that say something interesting about your data. As an example, you could combine the codes “Netflix” and “HBO” into a single theme called “Streaming services”. Searching for themes is an iterative process where you move codes back and forth to try forming different themes. Drawing a map of your codes and themes or having codes on sticky notes that you can move around can help you visualize the relationship between different codes and themes as well as the level of the themes. Some themes might be subthemes to others. In this process, not all codes will fit together with other codes. Some codes can become themes themselves if they are interesting, while other codes might seem redundant, and you can place them in a temporary mixed theme. At this point, you shouldn’t throw away codes that don’t seem to fit anywhere, as they may be of interest later.

4. Reviewing Themes
During phase 4, you review and refine the themes that you identified during phase 3. You read through all the extracts related to the codes in order to explore if they support the theme, if there are contradictions and to see if themes overlap. In the words of Braun and Clarke, “Data within themes should cohere together meaningfully, while there should be clear and identifiable distinctions between themes.” If there are many contradictions within a theme or it becomes too broad, you should consider splitting the theme into separate themes or moving some of the codes/extracts into an existing theme where they fit better.

You keep doing this until you feel that you have a set of themes that are coherent and distinctive; then you go through the same process again in relation to your entire data set. You read through all your data again and consider if your themes adequately represent the interesting themes in your interview and if there is uncoded data that should be coded because it fits into your theme. In this process, you might also discover new themes that you have missed. Phase 4 is an iterative process, where you go back and forth between themes, codes, and extracts until you feel that you have coded all the relevant data and you have the right number of coherent themes to represent your data accurately. In this iterative process, you might feel as though you can keep perfecting your themes endlessly, so stop when you can no longer add anything of significance to the analysis.

5. Defining and Naming Themes
During phase 5, you name and describe each of the themes you identified in the previous steps. Theme names should be descriptive and (if possible) engaging. In your description of the theme, you don’t just describe what the theme is about, but you also describe what is interesting about the theme and why it’s interesting. In Braun and Clarke’s words, you “define the essence that each theme is about”. As you describe the theme, you identify which story the theme tells and how this story relates to other themes as well as to your overall research question. At this point in the analysis, you should find yourself able to tell a coherent story about the theme, perhaps with some subthemes. It should be possible for you to define what your theme is clearly. Moreover, if you find that the theme is too diverse or complex for you to tell a coherent story, you might need to go back to phase 4 and rework your themes.

6. Producing the Report
What the final report looks like depends on your project; you might want your final delivery to be personas or user scenarios, but there are some commonalities you should always include. When you write up your results, there should always be enough information about your project and process for the reader to evaluate the quality of your research. Given that, you should write up a clear account of what you have done—both when you carried out the research and for your analysis. You already have a description of your themes, and you can use this as a basis for your final report. When you present your themes, use quotes from what the participants said to demonstrate your findings.
