## Introduction

Welcome to Researching Social Life 1. My name is Chris Moreh, your module leader.[^1]
You probably still remember me form last year's Knowing in Sociology, where in the second half of the module I introduced some of the methodological approaches that we will be looking at in a much more applied way here.
Before I briefly introduce the module and the semester, here's a reminder that you can contact me at my e-mail address and you can see me at the advertised office hours during the course of the module.
